(Pima County Sheriff’s Department via AP, File) TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) — The FBI is not aware of ongoing communication between Savannah Guthrie’s family and any suspected kidnappers more than a week after the “Today” show host’s mom went missing, the agency said Monday. The FBI has also not identified any suspects or persons of interest in the disappearance of 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie, Connor Hagan, a spokesperson for the FBI, said in a statement. The agency is operating a 24-hour command post equipped with investigative teams and crisis management experts while asking for help from the public. “Someone has that one piece of information that can help us bring Nancy home,” he said. In a video released Monday, Savannah Guthrie said the family was “at an hour of desperation” but that they continue to believe her mother is out there and hearing everyone’s prayers. “She was taken and we don’t know where, and we need your help,” Guthrie said in the video posted on Instagram, urging people nationwide to be on the lookout “no matter where you are, even if you’re far from Tucson, if you see anything, if you hear anything.” By Monday evening, a purported ransom deadline apparently set by her mom’s abductors appeared to have passed. The mysterious disappearance and search has riveted the country — from President Donald Trump, who spoke with Savannah Guthrie last week, to the online sleuths who’ve flooded social media with tips, theories and rumors. The FBI is asking for the public’s help on digital billboards up in several major cities in Texas, California, Arizona and New Mexico. The FBI has offered a $50,000 reward for information. Multiple news outlets received alleged ransom letters during the past week. At least one letter made monetary demands and set deadlines for receiving the money. The first deadline passed last Thursday and a second one was set for Monday evening. Law enforcement officials declined to affirm that the letters were credible but said all tips were being investigated seriously. The Pima County Sheriff’s Department said Monday that law enforcement tip lines have received thousands of calls. Authorities say they have growing concerns about Nancy Guthrie’s health because she needs daily medication. She is said to have a pacemaker and has dealt with high blood pressure and heart issues, according to sheriff’s dispatcher audio on broadcastify.com. In a video Saturday, Savannah Guthrie said the family was prepared to pay for her mother’s return. “This is the only way we will have peace. This is very valuable to us, and we will pay.” Authorities believe Nancy Guthrie was taken against her will from her home just outside Tucson. She was last seen there Jan. 31 and reported missing the next day after not attending church. DNA tests showed blood on Guthrie’s front porch was a match to her, and her doorbell camera was disconnected in the early hours of Sunday morning, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos has said. Speaking to reporters, Tucson resident Chuchi Ruiz, who stopped by Nancy Guthrie’s house to bring flowers and offer support, says news of her disappearance has shaken the community. Outside the home on Monday, neighbors strolled by on their morning jogs and walks, while a county sheriff’s deputy remained stationed out front. Law enforcement’s work at Guthrie residences will continue Tuesday “as part of the ongoing investigative process, including the expansion of the search and follow-up on new leads,” the Pima County Sheriff’s Department said in a statement Monday. Detectives and agents carried out follow-up work in the neighborhood and other locations over the weekend as part of the investigation, the Pima County Sheriff’s Department said Sunday. Investigators on Saturday were inside daughter Annie Guthrie’s home, about 4 miles (6 kilometers) from Nancy Guthrie’s house. On Sunday, an investigator was seen using a pole to search an underground tank behind Nancy Guthrie’s home. Copyright 2026 The Associated Press.

Migratory beekeepers in India’s Assam state travel from mustard farm to mustard farm timing it just for when the flowers bloom. However, climate change fuels extreme weather that can affect the bees’ behavior and survival, decreasing honey production. (AP video shot by: Anupam Nath) BINNABARI, India (AP) — The beekeepers rise early. They’ve come a long way to spend the winter months in the electric yellow mustard fields of Assam, and they have to make the trip worth it. At dawn, they eat a simple breakfast and won’t eat again until dusk. They’ll spend all day checking the hives, smoking them to disperse the bees so they can collect thick golden honeycombs to be sold overseas. It’s a demanding job. Stings are a fact of life. At night, the workers settle in under blue tarpaulins and think of the families they’ve left behind, sometimes for months at a time, to move their wooden bee boxes to this place. But the harvest is a way to make ends meet. “I earn an income, that’s why I do business,” said Karan Raj, a beekeeper from Bihar.

(AP Photo/Anupam Nath) Migratory beekeepers have moved their colonies of bees from field to field for decades in India, following the bloom of flowers to help farmers with pollination and collecting the honey. The practice is relatively new but growing in Assam, where local and migratory beekeepers alike are turning to the farms in the region to support what they say is a growing demand for honey. But climate change threatens all that. Beekeepers are persisting in the face of floods, more powerful monsoons and extreme heat, as well as development that changes the landscapes bees rely on. “If the weather is fine, the production will be fine. If the weather spoils, then there is no production. Weather has an effect. The weather needs to be good,” said Ranjeet Kumar, another beekeeper.

(AP Photo/Anupam Nath) Assam, nestled east of Bangladesh and south of the Himalayas, is a region where the extremes of climate change have already unleashed catastrophe as human-caused warming makes rainfall more intense and erratic. Flooding and landslides in 2024 killed over 100 people, and many farmers have seen their crops destroyed and had to evacuate repeatedly. “The pattern of rain is changing,” said Mukul Kumar Deka, who studies honeybees and other pollinators at Assam Agricultural University. When it’s too dry for too long, there’s less nectar available. When it’s too hot or too rainy, the bees stay in their hives.

(AP Photo/Anupam Nath) Assam is now seeing over 20 more heat-wave days than it did 10 years ago, and both average maximum temperatures and nighttime low temperatures have increased by about 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), according to 2025 research from Madhya Kamrup College in Assam. “Nowadays most of the farmers are getting less honey,” Deka said. A migratory beekeeper shows a bee on his finger near a mustard field in the Binnabari village in Baksa district of Assam, India, Thursday, Jan. 15, 2026. (AP Photo/Anupam Nath) Migratory beekeepers usually use Western honeybees, a departure from the practice of many traditional growers who keep local species of bees. Those local species, however, are in some cases under greater threat due to extreme weather and human development of projects like highways that plow through their habitats.

(AP Photo/Anupam Nath) “The bees that are in the trees, the ones that are in the forest, those bees have reduced drastically,” Raj said. For the Western ones, “we feed them sugar and raise them, and this is why they survive, as long as we care for them.” As more migratory beekeepers turn to Assam and bring commercial honeybees with them, that could create competition with small farmers who are increasingly turning to beekeeping for money. “If we try to rear the Western honeybee in more numbers, there will be a problem to our indigenous species,” Deka said.

(AP Photo/Anupam Nath) But some programs still encourage farmers to rear local bees and it’s especially critical for small farmers living below the poverty line. Besides selling honey, the pollination helps their crops, said Sujana Krishnamoorthy, executive director of the Under the Mango Tree Society, a nonprofit that teaches beekeeping to small farmers. “We’re also having to train farmers on how to better manage climate events,” Krishnamoorthy said. But beekeeping still helps. They become a little more resilient to climate change because they get extra income from honey products as well as improved pollination that increases crop yields. She added that many of the traditional crops grown by small farmers, like hedgerow or medicinal plants, are still fairly climate-resilient.

In some cases, the government is subsidizing beekeeping equipment, said Deka of Assam Agricultural University. “There may be ups and downs, but ultimately beekeeping will be sustained here,” Deka said.

(AP Photo/Lindsey Wasson) LIVIGNO, Italy (AP) — Chloe Kim and Eileen Gu, two Olympic standouts who have faced their share of hate over the years, each weighed in Monday on Donald Trump’s bashing of their friend, American freeskier Hunter Hess, for having said he didn’t back the U.S. president’s heightened crackdown on immigrants. “I think in moments like these, it is really important for us to unite and kind of stand up for one another for all that’s going on,” said Kim, the two-time Olympic gold medalist whose parents are South Korean immigrants and who has faced racism throughout her career for her Asian heritage. Gu, the American-born freeskier who competes for China, said after her silver-medal win in slopestyle that she had been in touch with Hess, who told her she was one of the few people who could relate to what he’s going through. “As someone who’s been caught in the crossfire before, I feel sorry for the athletes,” said Gu, who was born in San Francisco and whose decision to compete for China turned her into a lightning rod. Hess drew Trump’s ire when he was asked by reporters to give his views on the immigration crackdown that has claimed the lives of two protestors in Minnesota and disrupted thousands of lives of immigrants and U.S. citizens. Hess answered: “Just because I’m wearing the flag doesn’t mean I represent everything that’s going on in the U.S.” The next day, Trump lashed out at Hess on his Truth Social account, calling him “a real Loser” and saying he would be hard pressed to root for him at the Games. Hess’s friends — snowboarders and freeskiers competing this week in Livigno — were asked for their reaction. “My parents being immigrants from Korea, this one definitely hits pretty close to home,” said Kim, who begins defense of her title Wednesday. “I’m really proud to represent the United States,” she said. “The U.S. has given my family and I so much opportunity, but I also think that we are allowed to voice our opinions of what’s going that we need to lead with love and compassion.” Other American snowboarders spoke out for diversity and the right of expression. “I think there are a lot of different opinions in the U.S. right now. Obviously we’re very divided,” snowboarder Bea Kim said. “I personally am very proud to represent the United States. That being said, I think diversity is what makes us a very strong country and what makes that so special.” Teammate Maddie Mastro added: “I’m also saddened with what’s happening at home.” “It’s really tough and I feel like we can’t turn a blind eye to that. But at the same time, I represent a country that has the same values as mine of kindness and compassion. And we come together in times of injustice,” Mastro said. Gu called it “an unwinnable press war” for Hess and lamented the fact that the controversy could be a distraction for the athletes, and overshadow the beauty of the biggest event in winter sports. “I’m sorry that the headline that is eclipsing the Olympics has to be something so ... unrelated to the spirit of the Games,” she said. “It really runs contrary to everything that the Olympics should be.” ___ AP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics Copyright 2026 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, File) Wheaton College students stop to chat on the Norton, Mass. campus, Feb. 13, 2024 as snow falls. (Mark Stockwell/The Sun Chronicle via AP, File) NEW YORK (AP) — It’s been a confusing time for people with student loans. Collections restarted, then were put on hold. At the same time, borrowers had to stay on top of changes to key forgiveness plans. Last year, the long-contested SAVE plan introduced by the Biden administration ended with a settlement agreement. President Donald Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” introduced new borrowing limits for graduates and raised challenges to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. While several changes for student loan borrowers will take effect this summer, other key questions remain unresolved. More than 5 million Americans were in default on their federal student loans as of September, according to the Education Department. Millions are behind on loan payments and at risk of default this year. Borrowers “genuinely struggle to afford their loans and then to hear that the administration is making it more expensive and taking away some of the tools and resources that help folks afford their loans is really, it’s panic-inducing,” said Winston Berkman-Breen, legal director at Protect Borrowers. Last month, the Education Department announced that it would delay involuntary collections for student loan borrowers in default until the department finalizes its new loan repayment plans. The date for this is still unclear. If you’re a student loan borrower, here are some key things to know: The SAVE plan was a repayment plan with some of the most lenient terms ever. Soon after its launch it was challenged in court, leaving millions of student loan borrowers in limbo. Last December, the Education Department announced a settlement agreement to end the SAVE plan. What is next for borrowers who were enrolled in this repayment plan is yet to be determined. “Seven and a half million borrowers who are currently enrolled in SAVE need to be moved to another plan,” Berkman-Breen said. As part of the agreement, the Education Department says it will not enroll new borrowers, deny pending applications, and will move all current SAVE borrowers into other repayment plans. The Education Department is expected to develop a plan for borrowers to transition from the SAVE plan, yet borrowers should be proactive about enrolling in other repayment plans, said Kate Wood, a lending expert at NerdWallet. Borrowers can apply for the following income-driven plans: the Income-Based Repayment Plan, the Pay as You Earn plan, and the Income-Contingent Repayment plan. “They all have similar criteria, and they function similarly. Your payment is set as a percentage of your income, not how much you owe, so it’s usually a lower payment,” Berkman-Breen said. The payment amount under income-driven plans is a percentage of your discretionary income, and the percentage varies depending on the plan. Since many people are looking to switch plans, some applications to income-driven repayment plans might take longer to process, said Jill Desjean, director of policy analysis at the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators. You can find out which repayment plan might work best for you by logging on to the Education Department’s loan simulator. There are no changes to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program yet. Last year, the Trump administration announced plans to change the eligibility requirements for participating nonprofits. The policy seeks to disqualify nonprofit workers if their work is deemed to have “substantial illegal purpose.” The Trump administration said it’s necessary to block taxpayer money from lawbreakers, while critics say it turns the program into a tool of political retribution. The proposal says illegal activity includes the trafficking or “chemical castration” of children, illegal immigration, and supporting foreign terrorist organizations. This move could cut off some teachers, doctors, and other public workers from federal loan cancellation. “This is something that obviously is very stressful, very nerve-wracking for a lot of people, but given that we don’t know exactly how this is going to be enforced, how these terms are going to be defined, it’s not really something that you can try to plan ahead for now,” Wood said. While this policy is currently being challenged by 20 Democrat-led states, it’s expected to take effect in July. In the meantime, Wood recommends that borrowers enrolled in the PSLF program continue making payments. Involuntary collections on federal student loans will remain on hold. The Trump administration announced earlier this month that it is delaying plans to withhold pay from student loan borrowers who default on their payments. Federal student loan borrowers can have their wages garnished and their federal tax refunds withheld if they default on their loans. Borrowers are considered in default when they are at least 270 days behind on payments. If your student loans are in default, you can contact your loan holder to apply for a loan rehabilitation program. “They essentially come up with a payment plan where you’re making a reduced payment,” Woods. “After five successful payments on that rehabilitation plan, wage garnishment will cease.” Trump’s “ Big Beautiful Bill ” has changed the amount graduate students can borrow from federal student loans. Graduate students could previously borrow loans up to the cost of their degree; the new rules cap the amount depending on whether the degree is considered a graduate or a professional program. Wood said that if you’re starting a new program and taking out a loan after July 1, you will be subject to the new loan limits. Under the new plan, students in professional programs would be able to borrow up to $50,000 per year and up to $200,000 in total. Other graduate students, such as those pursuing nursing and physical therapy, would be limited to $20,500 a year and up to $100,000 total. The Education Department is defining the following fields as professional programs: pharmacy, dentistry, veterinary medicine, chiropractic, law, medicine, optometry, osteopathic medicine, podiatry and theology. The online application for loan consolidation is available at studentaid.gov/loan-consolidation. If you have multiple federal student loans, you can combine them into a single loan with a fixed interest rate and a single monthly payment. The consolidation process typically takes around 60 days to complete. You can only consolidate your loans once. ___ The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

(AP) — Punxsutawney Phil predicted six more weeks of wintry weather Monday, a forecast sure to disappoint many after what’s already been a long, cold season across large parts of the United States. His annual prediction and announcement that he had seen his shadow was translated by his top hat-wearing handlers in the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club at Gobbler’s Knob in western Pennsylvania. The news was greeted with a mix of cheers and boos from the tens of thousands who braved temperatures in the single-digits Fahrenheit to await the annual prognostication. The extreme cold kept the crowd bundled up and helped keep people on the main stage dancing. Usually guests can come up on stage and take pictures of Phil after his prediction, but this year the announcer said it was too cold for that and his handlers were afraid to keep him out too long. Instead, the audience was asked to come to the stage, turn around and “do a selfie.” AP correspondent Julie Walker reports groundhog Punxsutawney Phil predicts six more weeks of winter. In New York, the ceremony for Staten Island Chuck was streamed live but closed to the public because of the cold. Chuck was said to have also predicted six more weeks of winter. The Punxsutawney club says that when Phil is deemed to have not seen his shadow, that means there will be an early spring. When he does see it, it’s six more weeks of winter. Phil tends to predict a longer winter far more often than an early spring. The annual ritual goes back more than a century, with ties to ancient farming traditions in Europe. Punxsutawney’s festivities have grown considerably since the 1993 movie “Groundhog Day,” starring Bill Murray. Phil isn’t the only animal being consulted for long-term weather forecasts Monday. There are formal and informal Groundhog Day events in many places in the U.S., Canada and beyond. Michael Venos, who tracks Groundhog Day predictions at countdowntogroundhogday.com, said the early results Monday indicated a split verdict — 25 for winter and 22 for spring. That’s just the start — Venos expects to tally about 100 events. Agreeing with Punxsutawney Phil that more winter weather is on the way this year have been Buffalo Bert, a New York groundhog, and groundhog mascot Dover Doug in Pennsylvania. Also in the “more winter” camp were That Dog Named Gidget, a Havanese in New York, and possum Birmingham Jill in Alabama. In Georgia, General Beauregard Lee waddled outside and tried to get into the hollow part of a log before an announcer proclaimed that he had seen his shadow, prompting groans from the crowd at the Dauset Trails Nature Center southeast of Atlanta. Those predicting an early spring include groundhogs Buckeye Chuck in Ohio, Fig Newton in North Carolina and Shubenacadie Sam in Nova Scotia, along with Benny the Bass, a fish in Ohio, and Pennsylvania ferret Jessup Giuseppe. A crowd cheered in Albertville, Alabama, when Sam Mountain Sam, a possum, was said to have predicted an early spring. Sam arrived for his annual forecast carried in a whiskey barrel pulled by a convoy of wagons and horses. Lisa Gibson of Pittsburgh was at her 10th Groundhog Day in Punxsutawney, wearing a lighted hat that resembled the tree stump from which Phil emerged shortly after daybreak. “Oh man, it just breaks up the doldrums of winter,” said Gibson, accompanied by her husband — dressed up as Elvis Presley — and teenage daughter. “It’s like Halloween and New Year’s Eve all wrapped up into one holiday.” Groundhog Day falls on Feb. 2, the midpoint between the shortest, darkest day of the year on the winter solstice and the spring equinox. This time of year also figures in the Celtic calendar and the Christian holiday of Candlemas. Rick Siger, Pennsylvania’s secretary of community and economic development, said the outdoor thermometer in his vehicle read 4 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 15 degrees Celsius) on his way to Gobbler’s Knob. “I think it’s just fun — folks having a good time,” said Siger, attending his fourth straight Groundhog Day in Punxsutawney. “It brings people together at a challenging time.

(Angie Moser/Voracious via AP) Oxtail is one of my favorite meats, and I like it best when it has been slow-cooked for hours, so I recommend cooking it the day before and letting it sit overnight. What makes this dish from my cookbook “The Rise” so homey and delicious is the mix of the oxtail and the dumplings, which everyone can relate to as being an example of comfort food at its finest. This traditional Caribbean dish — mostly from Guyana — is made by stewing meat in a dark, rich gravy flavored with cinnamon, brown sugar, hot chiles, and cassareep, a special brown sauce made from cassava root. African Americans adapted the recipe using oxtail instead of offal, which are the internal organs of butchered animals. Regardless, this is a dish that only gets better with time in the pot. Servings: 4 to 6 OXTAIL 1 (4-pound) piece oxtail 1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper ½ cup vegetable oil 2 carrots, peeled and diced 1 onion, diced 21 cloves garlic, minced 7 tablespoons minced ginger (3-inch piece) 2 plum tomatoes, diced 2 scallions, sliced 1 Scotch bonnet (or habanero) chile, stemmed and chopped 3 sprigs fresh thyme 7 tablespoons brown sugar 2 tablespoons soy sauce 2 tablespoons ketchup 1 tablespoon whole allspice berries 6 cups chicken stock DUMPLINGS 2 cups all-purpose flour 2½ tablespoons cornmeal 1 teaspoon kosher salt ½ cup plus 2 tablespoons water For the oxtail: Season the oxtail on all sides with salt and pepper. Heat ¼ cup of the oil in a large (8-quart) Dutch oven set over medium-high heat. When the oil shimmers, add the oxtail and brown on both sides, about 15 minutes. Remove the oxtail to a paper-towel-lined dish. Heat the remaining ¼ cup oil in the Dutch oven and add the carrots, onion, garlic, ginger, tomatoes, scallions, chile, thyme, brown sugar, soy sauce, ketchup, and allspice and stir to combine. Return the oxtail to the pot, add the chicken stock, and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to maintain a simmer and cook, covered, for 2½ hours, or until the oxtail is tender and the meat is falling away from the bone. For the dumplings: Place the flour, cornmeal, and salt in a medium bowl and stir to combine. Add the water and use your hands to work the mixture into a dough ball. Knead the dough in the bowl for 2 to 3 minutes. Divide the dough in half and cover one half with a damp towel. Continue to knead one dough ball for 5 minutes, or until smooth. Roll the piece of dough into a 21- to 24-inch snakelike piece. Cut the dough into 1-inch pieces, set on a baking sheet, and cover with a damp towel. Repeat with remaining dough ball. Stir the dumplings into the oxtail stew for the last 30 minutes of cooking time and cook until dumplings are tender and cooked through. Serve the stew with rice and peas. ___ Marcus Samuelsson is the chef behind many restaurants worldwide.

(Matthew Pearson/WABE via AP) ATLANTA (AP) — Seven months after the collapse of an alleged $140 million Ponzi scheme that touched the top ranks of Republican politics in Georgia and Alabama, some investors are impatient to get their money back. “We feel like we’re never going to see it, as old as we are,” Thomas Todd, a 77-year-old retired business owner, told Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in a meeting Monday. Raffensperger says his office is stepping up efforts even as Republican state lawmakers want to transfer securities regulation to the Georgia Department of Banking and Finance, faulting the secretary of state’s securities division for not detecting wrongdoing at First Liberty Building & Loan before it went bust. Federal investigators said the company defrauded at least 300 investors of at least $140 million. Raffensperger is running for governor, and his office’s anti-fraud efforts could become an issue in May’s Republican primary. Brant Frost IV, who led First Liberty, had decades of involvement in conservative politics. His company said it was a lender making high-interest short-term loans to businesses, paying investors up to 16% annual interest. Touting “Wall Street returns for Main Street investors,” a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit claims Frost stole $17 million for himself, his relatives and affiliated companies, and loaned millions more that borrowers never repaid. Among those who lost money were a company run by former Georgia GOP Chairman David Shafer, Alabama state Auditor Andrew Sorrell, and a political action committee controlled by the Republican Sorrell. Party activists have said many grassroots Republicans lost money, while others were lured by ads on shows hosted by conservatives including Erick Erickson, Hugh Hewitt and Charlie Kirk. A federal court has appointed a receiver to recover money for investors. Receiver Gregory Hays wrote Jan. 30 that he’s still piecing together 48,000 financial transactions and that some borrowers are fighting to retain real estate and other collateral that the receiver says was pledged to secure loans. Hays reported $3.59 million in assets on hand as of Dec. 31. Since then, an auctioneer has sold five luxury vehicles that the Frost family handed over, netting almost $139,000. The receiver is also selling the First Liberty office in the Atlanta suburb of Newnan for $581,000, but first has to settle a $160,000 lien on the property. He also sold Frost’s Patek Phillipe watch for $10,000. Hays said he’s also received more than $300,000 back from more than 1,000 political donations that the Frost family made using more than $1 million in investor funds. Those funds often backed far-right Republican insurgents. But Hays says he’s spent $412,000 so far that will come from investor money. Hays wrote that asset recovery “will be an expensive and protracted process.” Todd and other investors on Monday bemoaned their choices to Raffensperger. Todd said he lost $750,000 and that First Liberty collapsed just before he invested more. Todd said he was using the income to fund Christian missions. calling it “God’s money.” “They were stealing it,” Todd said. “They knew they were stealing it. And they were working at stealing it, because they knew they were in trouble.” Raffensperger’s office recently announced lawyer Jason Doss as an investigative agent. Raffensperger proposes a new state law letting his office order fraudsters to directly repay investors. For now, his office is limited to civil actions against wrongdoers and passing information to the receiver and state and federal prosecutors. It’s unclear whether federal prosecutors will seek charges. A spokesperson for Atlanta U.S. Attorney Theodore Hertzberg declined to comment Monday. Georgia House lawmakers who have gotten an earful from defrauded Republicans are pushing to give securities regulation to banking regulators. Assistant Commissioner of Securities Noula Zaharis told the House Banks and Banking Committee on Thursday that shifting employees and responsibilities away from Raffensperger’s office on July 1, as House Bill 934 proposes, could disrupt regulation. She also said Ponzi schemes are hard to detect. “Schemes like this are set up to create an illusion and they are schemes that pay,” Zaharis said. But Republicans faulted her staff for not catching First Liberty. “I just don’t really see a system or plan in place to preemptively identify these things and eliminate these bad actors before they get too far gone,” said Republican state Rep.

(AP Photo/Ramon Espinosa) HAVANA (AP) — Cuban aviation officials have warned airlines that there isn’t enough fuel for airplanes to refuel on the island, the latest step in its moves to ration energy as the Trump administration cuts the Caribbean nation off from its fuel resources. The government of Cuba published the notices to airlines and pilots on Sunday night, warning that jet fuel won’t be available at nine airports across the island, including José Martí International Airport in Havana, starting Tuesday and continuing until March 11. Political pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump on Latin America has effectively severed Cuba’s access to its primary petroleum sources in Venezuela and Mexico. In late January, Trump signed an executive order that would impose a tariff on any goods from countries that sell or provide oil to Cuba, a move that could further cripple an island plagued by a deepening energy crisis. While the rationing may not disrupt shorter regional flights, it presents a significant challenge for long-haul routes from countries like Russia and Canada — a critical pillar of Cuba’s tourism economy. On Monday, Air Canada announced it was suspending flights to the island, while other airlines announced delays and layovers in the Dominican Republic before flights continued to Havana. One pilot added that while refueling issues have occurred before, an official announcement of this scale is extraordinary even for an island accustomed to perpetual crisis. The last time such cuts occurred — more than a decade ago — aircraft bound for Europe refueled in Nassau, Bahamas, the pilot recalled. Now, regional airlines could avoid problems by bringing extra fuel, while others could refuel in Cancun, Mexico, or in the Dominican Republic. It remains unclear how long the notice will remain in effect and Cuban officials have made no public comments on the matter. The fuel shortage deals another blow to a country that relies heavily on tourism, an industry that once generated $3 billion in annual revenue and served as a vital economic lifeline. Cuban officials also announced Monday that bank hours have been reduced and cultural events suspended. In Havana, the public bus system has effectively ground to a halt, leaving residents stranded as endemic power outages and grueling fuel lines reach a breaking point. The energy emergency has forced the suspension of major events like the Havana International Book Fair this weekend and a restructuring of the national baseball season for greater efficiency. Some banks have cut operating hours and fuel distribution companies said they would no longer sell gas in Cuban pesos — and that sales will be made in dollars and limited to 20 liters (5.28 gallons) per user. The latest measures add to others announced Friday, including cuts to bus transportation and limited train departures. On Thursday, Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel delivered a two-hour televised address, acknowledging the impact and warning that measures would be taken in the coming days. U.S. sanctions against Cuba have been in place for more than six decades and have long stunted Cuba’s economy. But they reached new extremes after a U.S. military operation deposed former Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, and Trump began to take an even more confrontational tone toward Latin America. For many Cubans, the crisis has translated into power outages lasting up to 10 hours, fuel shortages for vehicles, and a lack of food or medicine that many compare to the severe economic depression in the 1990s known as the Special Period that followed cuts in aid from what was then the Soviet Union. —— Associated Press journalists Joshua Funk in Omaha, Nebraska and Megan Janetsky in Mexico City contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s Latin America coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america Copyright 2026 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Lynne Sladky) SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl halftime performance translated into an immediate surge in global listening, with new data from Apple Music showing sharp gains across streaming charts, playlists and music discovery platforms in the hours following the show. Apple Music, a Super Bowl halftime show sponsor, said Monday that Bad Bunny’s show playlist became the most-played set list on the music streaming platform shortly after the performance. The Puerto Rican superstar went on to dominate the Apple Music Daily Top 100 Global chart, landing 23 songs in the Top 100, including nine in the Top 25 and five in the Top 10. His track “DtMF” rose to No. 1. Several of the charting songs marked notable returns. Six of the 23 tracks re-entered the daily Top 100 Global for the first time since at least February 2025. His collaboration on the song “I Like It” with Cardi B and J Balvin re-entered the chart for the first time since January 2020. Apple Music data also showed widespread international momentum. On Monday, Bad Bunny’s album “Debí Tirar Más Fotos,” appeared on album charts in 155 countries, reaching the Top 10 in 128 countries and hitting No. 1 in 46, including Mexico, Colombia, Chile, Brazil, Germany, France and Spain. In the United States, Apple Music reported that the top cities for Bad Bunny listening over a six-day span were Los Angeles, New York, Chicago and Dallas. Music discovery platform Shazam reflected a similar spike in engagement. Apple Music said his performance Sunday marked the biggest day ever on Shazam for any Latin or non-English-language artist. Across Bad Bunny’s catalog, Shazam recognitions increased by more than 400% during and immediately following the halftime show compared to the daily average. Among the most-Shazamed moments during the performance were “Die with a Smile” featuring Lady Gaga and “Lo Que Le Pasó a Hawaii,” with Ricky Martin. While streaming platforms such as Spotify also report post-event listening trends, Apple Music’s data reflects immediate listening and discovery activity captured in the hours following the halftime show. The figures combine streaming behavior with Shazam recognition and geographic patterns, offering an early look at how the performance translated into audience engagement, ahead of broader industry reports that typically follow later. The surge follows years of growth for Bad Bunny on the platform, according to Oliver Schusser, vice president of Apple Music and Beats. “We have had the pleasure of working with Bad Bunny since 2016, and watching him grow into this massive global superstar has been incredible and exciting, but not at all surprising,” Schusser said. “His fans on Apple Music are very engaged, and I think these numbers reflect his huge influence and impact on music culture.” Copyright 2026 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Rod Lamkey, Jr., File) President Donald Trump smiles after signing a spending bill that ends a partial shutdown of the federal government in the Oval Office of the White House, Tuesday, Feb. 3, 2026, in Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) WASHINGTON (AP) — Americans’ hope for their future has fallen to a new low, according to new polling. In 2025, only about 59% of Americans gave high ratings when asked to evaluate how good their life will be in about five years, the lowest annual measure since Gallup began asking this question almost 20 years ago. It’s a warning about the depth of the gloom that has fallen over the country over the past few years. In the data, Gallup’s “current” and “future” lines have tended to move together over time — when Americans are feeling good about the present, they tend to feel optimistic about the future. But the most recent measures show that while current life satisfaction has declined over the last decade, future optimism has dropped even more. The finding comes from a longstanding Gallup question that asks Americans to rate their current and future lives on a scale from 0 to 10. Those who give themselves an 8 or higher on the question about the future are categorized as optimists. “While current life is eroding, it’s that optimism for the future that has eroded almost twice as much over the course of about that last 10 years or so,” said Dan Witters, the research director of the Gallup National Health and Well-Being Index. Gallup assesses people who rate their current life at a 7 or higher and their anticipated future at an 8 or higher as “thriving.” Fewer than half of Americans, about 48%, are now in that category. Democrats and Hispanic Americans, in particular, were in a darker mood last year. But even with President Donald Trump back in the White House and his party in control of both houses of Congress, Republicans aren’t feeling nearly as good about the future as they were in the last year of Trump’s first term. Americans’ attitudes toward the future tend to shift when a new political party enters the White House — generally, the party in power grows more optimistic, while the party without control is more down. For instance, Democrats became more positive about the future after Joe Biden won the presidency, while Republicans’ outlook soured. Witters notes that these changes typically happen “by roughly the same amount, same level of magnitude, so they cancel each other out.” That didn’t happen in 2025. Toward the end of Biden’s term and the start of Trump’s second term, Democrats’ optimism fell from 65% to 57%. Republicans grew more hopeful, but not enough to offset Democrats’ drop. “The regime change in the White House almost certainly was a big driving factor in what’s happened,” Witters said. “And a lot of that was just because the people who identified as Democrats really took it in the chops.” But Republicans are still quite a bit gloomier about the future than they were in the last year of Trump’s first term. A January AP-NORC poll found that while the vast majority of Republicans are still behind the president, his work on the economy hasn’t lived up to many people’s expectations. Hispanic adults’ optimism for the near future also declined during Trump’s first year in office, dropping from 69% to 63%. That decrease was sharper than among white and Black Americans, something that Witters said could be tied to overall cost concerns, health care worries or alarm about Trump’s recent immigration policies. Last year, a survey by the American Communities Project found that people living in heavily Hispanic areas were feeling less hopeful about their future than in 2024. Trump’s favorability fell among Hispanics over the course of 2025, according to AP-NORC polling, which also found that Hispanic adults reported higher levels of economic stress than other groups. A Pew Research Center poll conducted in October found that the administration’s tough immigration enforcement is highly visible in Hispanic communities. About 6 in 10 Latinos said they had seen or heard of Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids or arrests in their community in the past six months. “(Deportations are) something that everybody can see and look at with their own eyes,” Witters added. “But if you’re Hispanic, I think it’s fair to think that that might hit a little closer to home.” ___ This data is a part of the Gallup National Health and Well-Being Index. The 2025 results are based on data collected over four quarterly measurement periods, totaling 22,125 interviews with U.S. adults who are part of the probability-based Gallup Panel.

All Rights Reserved. Copyright 2026 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. An Icebreaker makes the path for a cargo ship with an iceberg in the background near a port on the Alexandra Land island near Nagurskoye, Russia, May 17, 2021. (AP Photo/Alexander Zemlianichenko, File) REYKJAVIK, Iceland (AP) — As rising global temperatures speed up the melting of sea ice in the Arctic Ocean, it’s set off a boom of ships taking routes that previously were frozen and not traversable. The increase in marine Arctic traffic, which received increased attention as U.S. President Donald Trump pushed for the United States to take over Greenland, has come with a heavy environmental cost: black carbon, or soot, that spews from ships and makes the ice melt even faster. Several countries are making a case for ships in the Arctic to use cleaner fuels that cause less pollution in meetings this week with international shipping regulators. Glaciers, snow and ice covered in the soot emitted by ships have less ability to reflect the sun. Instead, the sun’s heat is absorbed, helping to make the Arctic the fastest warming place on Earth. In turn, melting Arctic sea ice can affect weather patterns around the world. “It ends up in a never-ending cycle of increased warming,” said Sian Prior, lead adviser for the Clean Arctic Alliance, a coalition of nonprofits focused on the Arctic and shipping. “We need to regulate emissions and black carbon, in particular. Both are completely unregulated in the Arctic.” In December, France, Germany, the Solomon Islands and Denmark proposed that the International Maritime Organization require ships traveling in Arctic waters to use “polar fuels,” which are lighter and emit less carbon pollution than the widely used maritime fuels known as residuals. The proposal includes steps that companies would take to comply and show they are using cleaner fuels and the geographic area it would apply to — all ships traveling north of the 60th parallel. The proposal was expected to be presented this week to the IMO’s Pollution Prevention and Response Committee and possibly another committee in April. A 2024 ban on using a type of residual known as heavy fuel oil in the Arctic has had only modest impacts so far, partly because of loopholes. The push to reduce black carbon, which studies have shown has a warming impact 1,600 times that of carbon dioxide over a 20-year span, is happening at a time of conflicting interests, both internationally and among the countries that have coastlines in the Arctic. In recent months, Trump’s periodic comments about the need to “own” Greenland to bolster U.S. security have raised many issues, from Greenland’s sovereignty to the future of the NATO alliance. Pollution and other environmental issues in the Arctic have taken a backseat. Trump, who has called climate change a “con job,” has also pushed back against global policies aimed at fighting it. Last year, the IMO was expected to adopt new regulations that would have imposed carbon fees on shipping, which supporters said would have pushed companies to use cleaner fuels and electrify fleets where possible. Then Trump intervened, lobbying hard for nations to vote no. The measure was postponed for a year, its prospects at best uncertain. Given that, it’s hard to see the IMO making fast progress on the current proposal to limit black carbon in the Arctic. Even inside Arctic nations, which are most impacted by black carbon and other shipping pollution, there are internal tensions around such regulations. Iceland is a good example. While the country is a world leader in green technologies such as carbon capture and the use of thermal energies for heating, conservationists say the country has made less progress on regulating pollution in its seas. That is because the fishing industry, one of the country’s most important, holds huge sway. “The industry is happy with profits, unhappy with the taxes and not engaged in issues like climate or biodiversity,” said Arni Finnsson, board chair of the Iceland Nature Conservation Association. Finnsson added that the costs of using cleaner fuels or electrifying fleets have also prompted resistance. “I think the government is waking up, but they still have to wait for the (fishing) industry to say yes,” he said. The country has not taken a position on the pending polar fuels proposal. In a statement, Iceland’s Ministry of Environment, Energy and Climate said the proposal was “positive with regard to its purpose and basic content,” but that further study was needed. The statement added that Iceland supports stronger measures to counter shipping emissions and reduce black carbon. Soot pollution has increased in the Arctic as cargo ships, fishing boats and even some cruise liners are traveling more in the waters that connect the northernmost parts of Iceland, Greenland, Canada, Russia, Norway, Finland, Sweden and the United States. Between 2013 and 2023, the number of ships entering waters north of the 60th parallel increased by 37%, according to the Arctic Council, an intergovernmental forum made up of the eight countries with territory in the Arctic. In that same period, the total distance traversed by ships in the Arctic increased 111%. Black carbon emissions have also increased. In 2019, 2,696 metric tons of black carbon was emitted from ships north of the 60th parallel compared with 3,310 metric tons in 2024, according to a study by Energy and Environmental Research Associates. The study found that fishing boats were the biggest source of black carbon. It also found that the 2024 ban on heavy fuel oil would only result in a small reduction in black carbon. Waivers and exceptions allow some ships to continue using it until 2029. Environmental groups and concerned countries see regulating ship fuel as the only way to realistically reduce black carbon. That is because getting nations to agree to limit traffic would likely be impossible. The lure of fishing, resource extraction and shorter shipping distances is too great. Ships can save days on some trips between Asia and Europe by sailing through the Arctic. Still, the path known as the Northern Sea Route is only traversable a few months of the year, and even then ships must be accompanied by icebreakers. Those dangers, combined with Arctic pollution concerns, have driven some companies to pledge to stay away — at least for now. “The debate around the Arctic is intensifying, and commercial shipping is part of that discussion,” wrote Søren Toft, CEO of Mediterranean Shipping Company, the world’s largest container shipping company, in a LinkedIn post last month. “Our position at MSC is clear. We do not and will not use the Northern Sea Route.” ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

All Rights Reserved. Copyright 2026 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. MOUNT CLEMENS, Mich. (AP) — Two people were convicted of forgery and other crimes Monday in an election petition scandal that spoiled the candidacies of five Republicans who were running for Michigan governor in 2022. The petitions were rife with bogus signatures and, as a result, the candidates didn’t have enough valid ones to qualify for the GOP primary election that year. The candidates included former Detroit police Chief James Craig and millionaire businessman Perry Johnson, who is running again this year. No candidate was personally accused of knowingly submitting fraudulent petitions. The fraud “denied millions of Michiganders a choice in the 2022 gubernatorial election,” Attorney General Dana Nessel said. Shawn Wilmoth and Willie Reed were each convicted of forgery, running a criminal enterprise and other crimes after a trial in suburban Detroit. They will be sentenced March 18. Jamie Wilmoth was found not guilty. Defense lawyers tried to shift blame to dozens of petition circulators, telling the jury that Shawn Wilmoth and Reed were defrauded, too. Nine campaigns, including some Detroit-area judicial candidates, paid more than $700,000 to businesses affiliated with Reed and Shawn Wilmoth to get signatures, the attorney general’s office said.

A record snow drought with unprecedented heat is hitting most of the American West, depleting future water supplies, making it more vulnerable to wildfires and hurting winter tourism and recreation. (AP Video by Thomas Peipert) A record snow drought with unprecedented heat is hitting most of the American West, depleting future water supplies, making it more vulnerable to wildfires and hurting winter tourism and recreation. Scientists say snow cover and snow depth are both at the lowest levels they’ve seen in decades, while at least 67 Western weather stations have measured their warmest December through early February on record. Normal snow cover this time of year should be about 460,000 square miles — about the size of California, Utah, Idaho and Montana — but this year it’s only California-sized, about 155,000 square miles, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. “I have not seen a winter like this before,” said center director Mark Serreze, who has been in Colorado almost 40 years. “This pattern that we’re in is so darned persistent.” The snowpack — measured by how much water is trapped inside — in Oregon is not only record low, but 30% lower than the previous record, said Jason Gerlich, regional drought early warning system coordinator for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Much of the U.S. east of the Rockies is snowbound and enduring more than two weeks of bone-chilling abnormal cold, but in West Jordan, Utah, a suburb of Salt Lake City, Trevor Stephens went to the store last week in gym shorts and a T-shirt. “Right now there’s no snow on the ground,” he said in a video interview, looking out his window and lamenting the lack of snowboarding opportunities. “I’d definitely rather have icy roads and snow than whatever is going on out here right now.” With a backdrop of snowless mountains, a couple walk around the lake in Washington Park, Friday, Feb. 6, 2026, in Denver. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski) Ski resorts had already been struggling through a difficult season, but the lack of snow has been persistent enough that concerns are growing about wider effects. Oregon, Colorado and Utah have reported their lowest statewide snowpack since the early 1980s, as far back as records go. A dry January has meant most states have received half their average precipitation or even less. Along with sunny days and higher-than-average temperatures, that’s meant little snow buildup in a month that historically gets a lot of snow accumulation across much of the Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies. Because of heavy rains in December, California is in better shape than the other states, scientists said. As of Monday, it had been 327 days since Salt Lake City International Airport got 1 inch of snow, making it the longest stretch since 1890-91, according to the National Weather Service. The meager snow in Colorado and Utah has put the Upper Colorado River Basin at the heart of the snow drought, said Gerlich. A robust mountain snowpack that slowly melts as winter warms to spring provides a steady flow of water into creeks and rivers. That helps ensure there’s enough water later in the year for agriculture, cities, hydropower electric systems and more. But lack of snow or a too-fast melt means less water will replenish rivers like the Colorado later in the season. “This is a pretty big problem for the Colorado basin,” said Daniel Swain of the University of California’s Water Resources Institute. Experts said the snow drought could also kick-start an early wildfire season. Snow disappearing earlier than average leaves the ground exposed to warmer weather in the spring and summer that dries soils and vegetation quicker, said Daniel McEvoy, researcher with the Western Regional Climate Center.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski) While it’s been dry, the record-low snowpack is mostly due to how warm the West has been, which is connected to climate change from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, several scientists said. Since Dec. 1, there have been more than 8,500 daily high temperature records broken or tied in the West, according to NOAA data. Much of the precipitation that would normally fall as snow and stay in the mountains for months is instead falling as rain, which runs off quicker, Swain and other scientists said. It’s a problem scientists have warned about with climate change. Going snowless happens from time to time, but it’s the warmth that has been so extreme, which is easier to tie to climate change, said Russ Schumacher, professor of atmospheric science at Colorado State University and Colorado State Climatologist. “It was so warm, especially in December, that the snow was only falling at the highest parts of the mountains,” McEvoy said. “And then we moved into January and it got really dry almost everywhere for the last three to four weeks and stayed warm.” A flock of Canada geese sits in a small bank of dirt-covered snow melting in a parking lot, Friday, Feb. 6, 2026, in Sheridan, Colo. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski) Meteorologists expect wetter, cooler weather across the West this week with some snow so this may be the peak of the snow drought. But it’ll still be warmer than usual in many areas, and scientists aren’t optimistic the snow will be enough. “I don’t think there’s any way we’re going to go back up to, you know, average or anywhere close to that,” said Schumacher. “But at least we can chip away at those deficits a little bit if it does get more active.” ___ The Associated Press receives support from the Walton Family Foundation for coverage of water and environmental policy.

(AP Photo/John McDonnell) WASHINGTON (AP) — America’s 250th anniversary arrives at a time of deep political divisions and, in some quarters, heightened anxiety over whether representative government in the world’s oldest democracy can be sustained. Cultural institutions, sporting events, even communities are polarized. If there is any place the bitter partisanship is set aside, even temporarily, it is in the rotunda of the National Archives. This is home to the nation’s founding documents, including the one that will be commemorated this year, the Declaration of Independence. The room is filled with a silent sense of reverence as visitors gaze down at the light brown parchment, secured under bullet-proof glass, that helped create the foundation of a government that has been a beacon of inspiration for people around the world for more than two centuries. Its significance was not lost on those who filtered in on a recent day, braving a deep freeze in the nation’s capital to ensure they would not miss this stop on their Washington tour. Even as the crowd grew, the room was filled with a sense that people knew they were in the presence of something momentous. Their visits coincided with a national reckoning over President Donald Trump’s aggressive immigration enforcement actions, which had led to the shooting deaths of two U.S. citizens on the streets of Minneapolis and grave concerns about attacks on constitutional rights. The Associated Press interviewed visitors after they had viewed the Declaration of Independence, along with the Constitution and Bill of Rights, for their thoughts on the state of America and its future as it approached its semiquincentennial moment. They acknowledged the country’s ideological divides but were reluctant to assign blame, in many cases expressing hope the nation would be able to repair itself, as it has done many times over its history. With the Rotunda’s bus-sized oil on canvas paintings of the Founding Fathers as a backdrop, they gave complicated responses when asked whether America was living up to the ideals of its founding documents and where it might be headed. Ryan O’Neil, visiting from West Bloomfield, Michigan, said that while the country is split politically — what he called “very tribal” — he finds hope in the documents he viewed at the National Archives because they have guided the country for 250 years. “We’ve not yet lived up to everything that we had hoped to, but we are continuing to progress and get closer to that,” he said. The Archives has a special exhibit marking the 250th anniversary, “The American Story,” that highlights that complex history, mixing the country’s astonishing accomplishments and advances with images showing its darker moments. O’Neil, 42, said the U.S. has been in similar divisive situations throughout its history and always managed to regroup. The one constant, he said is that the country’s political pendulum is always swinging. “Despite many tests over the years, going back to its founding, throughout the last 250 years it has withstood challenges, has withstood complaints, has withstood protests,” he said, “and continues to evolve to what we have today.” Kevin Sullivan had traveled to Washington from Milwaukee with his wife to visit their children and attend the confirmation of their oldest grandson. He acknowledged the country was in a divisive moment, but said it wasn’t the only one the country had faced, and that gave him hope for the future. “So I have some faith that we’ll put some of the uglier partisan disputes behind us,” he said. Sullivan, 69, said he supported at least a few of Trump’s goals, including securing the southern border, but was conflicted about the president’s approach. He opposed Democratic threats to shut off funding for the Department of Homeland Security without drastic reforms to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal law enforcement agencies, but he also said he didn’t like the mass deportation policy. His advice to lawmakers and the president would be to get away from the cameras and hold meaningful discussions to find solutions. Looking at the oil paintings with images of the founders, he said having an equivalent of today’s media trying to report on the writing of the Declaration probably “would not have been a positive development for the decisions and the discussions that were going on at Independence Hall.” The Rev. Michael Stokes, a priest with the Church of England, was visiting friends in the Washington area. Before heading to the rotunda, he saw the Magna Carta, the English document signed in 1215 that set up a series of rights for the people and served as a model for America’s system of government. Stokes, 30, said others look at the diversity of people, religions and industry that all come together “for this one common purpose of America.” It’s a vision that has inspired the world, he said, but also is one that appears to be waning. “I think this is the time in history where it’s been challenged the most with the actions of the current administration. I think that the rest of the world is looking and seeing how this thing, this Constitution, which is held with such pride, the Bill of Rights, which is held with pride, how can that also be held in tension with a popularly elected government that seems to disregard so much of it,” Stokes said. “And I think the rest of the world is looking at that with some confusion.” Morgan Whitman, an executive assistant, was in Washington on business from Miami and was seeing the documents for the first time. She said reading them created a mix of emotions. The ideals were lofty, she said, but “there’s also of course the feelings of hypocrisy” because Thomas Jefferson had argued for a passage opposing slavery that was not included. “So I think we have this document that fought for independence and life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness,” she said. “My only wish was that it was for everybody at the time.” Whitman, 25, said she is grateful for being granted rights that many others around the world do not have, but also said she is afraid some of those are under threat. She cited the killing by federal agents of Veterans Affairs ICU nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis. “Take immigration out of it. These are American citizens that are being harmed now,” she said. “That’s unacceptable.” Jerry Curl was visiting the capital with his wife, Bobbi, from their home in Diamond, Illinois. A Trump supporter, he said the president’s second term has so far “lived up to my beliefs.” But he also said he has stepped away from news coverage recently because it is too negative. When asked about the administration’s immigration enforcement, he wanted to see more discussions where people could share their views and do so respectfully. He said trying to understand one another is crucial to maintaining American democracy. ”We owe it to our future generations that we never meet to uphold this,” he said of the founding documents. Curl, 62, said the signers of the Declaration undoubtedly disagreed and had different beliefs, but they were able to find common ground as they took the first step to creating a new nation. He wonders whether the same spirit is alive today. “Where we can now find common grounds to keep this one great nation on track is hard for me to fathom,” he said. ___ Associated Press video journalist River Zhang in Washington contributed to this report.

(New England Wildlife Center via AP) PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — Wildlife officials say a “lizard in a blizzard” has been rescued after a man discovered the large cold-blooded reptile buried in snow in Rhode Island, somehow surviving the frigid temperatures. According to the New England Wildlife Center, the Providence man spotted the tegu lizard from his driveway on Tuesday. The reptile was quickly brought it indoors and wrapped in a T-shirt to help conserve heat. ET Reptiles, a reptile store based in Rhode Island, agreed to pick up the tegu and take it to an animal hospital. There, veterinarians found the tegu to be “extremely weak, underweight, and not moving well.” The tegu’s tongue had also suffered frostbite and muscle weakness due to prolonged exposure to the cold — a circumstance that leads to cell failure in cold-blooded animals in low temperatures. A small portion of the tegu’s tongue was amputated to help with its recovery. “He is now resting comfortably and finally warm, which makes all the difference!” the wildlife center said in a social media post. “We will be rooting for a good outcome and will share updates as we have them.” The center says it’s unknown if the lizard escaped on its own from wherever it was being kept or was abandoned. The black and white lizards are native to South America and have become popular in the pet trade. They have become known as an invasive species in certain states, like Florida, as more owners who had intended to keep them as pets abandon them into the wild. They can grow to 4 feet (122 centimeters) long. Copyright 2026 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.",center,2026-02-10T11:29:28.559047

(Pima County Sheriff’s Department via AP) TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) — Savannah Guthrie told the potential kidnappers of her mother Nancy Guthrie on Saturday that the family is prepared to pay for her safe return, as the frantic search for the 84-year-old Arizona resident has entered a seventh day. “We received your message, and we understand. We beg you now to return our mother to us so that we can celebrate with her,” she said in a video posted on social media, flanked by her siblings. “This is the only way we will have peace. This is very valuable to us, and we will pay.” The “Today” show host was referencing a message that was sent to the Tucson-based television station KOLD on Friday afternoon, according to Kevin Smith, a spokesperson for the FBI office in Phoenix. KOLD said it received an email related to the Guthrie case on social media that day but declined to share specific details about its contents as the FBI conducted its review. The station was one of multiple press outlets that received alleged ransom letters during the week. At least one letter made monetary demands and established Thursday evening and the following Monday evening as deadlines. In a news conference Thursday, law enforcement officials declined to affirm that the letters were credible but said all tips were being investigated seriously. They also said one letter referenced Nancy Guthrie’s Apple watch and a specific feature of her property. The video released Saturday was the third this week that pleaded with potential kidnappers. Investigators think Nancy Guthrie was taken against her will from her home just outside Tucson last weekend. DNA tests showed blood on Guthrie’s front porch was a match to her, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos has said. Authorities have not identified any suspects or ruled anyone out. The sheriff said Friday that he was frustrated that a camera at Nancy Guthrie’s home was not able to capture images of anyone the day she went missing. Investigators have found that the home’s doorbell camera was disconnected early Sunday and that software data recorded movement at the home minutes later. But Nancy Guthrie did not have an active subscription, so none of the images were able to be recovered. “It is concerning, it’s actually almost disappointing, because you’ve got your hopes up,” Nanos told The Associated Press in an interview. “OK, they got an image. ‘Well, we do, but we don’t.’” President Donald Trump, speaking on Air Force One on Friday, said the investigation was going “very well.” “We have some clues that I think are very strong,” Trump said, while en route to his Florida estate. “We have some things that may be coming out reasonably soon.” They were back in Nancy Guthrie’s neighborhood on Friday. The sheriff’s department posted on social media to say access was restricted to the road in front of the home to give investigators space. Journalists staked out there were directed to move. The Catalina Foothills Association, a neighborhood group, told residents in a letter that authorities were resuming searches in the area immediately. “I know we all stand together in our collective disbelief and sadness and greatly appreciate your willingness to speak with law enforcement, share camera images and allow searches of your properties,” the association president said in the letter. The sheriff said Thursday that investigators have not given up on trying to retrieve camera recordings. “I wish technology was as easy as we believe it is, that here’s a picture, here’s your bad guy. But it’s not,” Nanos told the AP. “There are pieces of information that come to us from these tech groups that say ‘this is what we have and we can’t get anymore.’” The sheriff also said he had no new information about the note to the TV station or other purported ransom letters sent to some media outlets, saying the FBI is handling that side of the investigation. Meanwhile concern about Nancy Guthrie’s health condition has grown, because authorities say she needs vital daily medicine. She is said to have a pacemaker and have dealt with high blood pressure and heart issues, according to sheriff’s dispatcher audio on broadcastify.com. “Her conditions, I would imagine, are worsening day by day,” Nanos said. “She requires medication. And I have no way of knowing whether they’re getting that medication to her.” The kidnapping has captured the attention of Americans, including Trump, who said he was directing federal authorities to help investigate. ___ Weber reported from Los Angeles.

(AP Photo/Luis Andres Henao) Rabbi Laura Geller recalls how of the 30 people in her class at Hebrew Union College, she was the only woman. Ordained in 1976, she would go on to become one of the first women rabbis in the Jewish Reform Movement. Fifty years later, she’s proud to have helped break that glass ceiling and pave the way for change. Rabbis and rabbinical students in the United States are more diverse than ever today, with increasing numbers of women and LGBTQ+ people. Women from earlier generations who became rabbis marvel at the greater opportunities available for those pursuing clergy roles. “Women have transformed Judaism,” said Geller, rabbi emerita of Temple Emanuel of Beverly Hills, California. “All the different kinds of movements have really noticed that Judaism needs to change because women’s voices were ignored in the past.” Orthodox branches of Judaism generally don’t allow women to be rabbis, with some exceptions. But Reform and Conservative, the largest movements in the U.S., permit it, as does the growing nondenominational branch. Nationwide, the Jewish community has become more diverse, so it makes sense that the rabbinate would be as well, said Janet Krasner Aronson, interim director of the Cohen Center for Modern Jewish Studies at Brandeis University. “A lot of people are entering the rabbinate and coming from very different backgrounds, and they really want to come in and shake things up a little bit,” she said. Rebecca Weintraub, associate rabbi of New York City’s B’nai Jeshurun congregation, has witnessed this generational shift in liberal Jewish spaces. She is one of several women serving the congregation as rabbis. “For a lot of the younger generation, when they think of a rabbi, many of them, in their mind, the picture is a woman,” Weintraub said. “When I was growing up, when I would think of a rabbi, I’d think, man.” An organization that supports and trains Jewish spiritual leaders — Atra: Center for Rabbinic Innovation — has new research documenting the diversification of the U.S. rabbinate and its student pipeline. It recently surveyed stakeholders including rabbis, students, schools and other key Jewish institutions. Atra’s research affirms that men still make up the majority of the more than 4,000-strong non-Ultra Orthodox U.S. rabbinate, but women are now a sizable minority. There are also more LGBTQ+ people, Jews of color and members of interfaith households. That increased diversity also is present in non-Orthodox rabbinical schools, where women are in the majority. “We see an opening that did not exist for populations that once were not able to become rabbis,” said Rabbi Shira Koch Epstein, Atra’s executive director. “We still don’t have parity of rabbis in the field, but we do see that we have many more women in the seminary.” Among them is Sarah Livschitz, who moved from New Zealand to Los Angeles to enroll in Hebrew Union College, where her student cohort is entirely female. “It’s normal to me that a woman would be a rabbi,” said Livschitz, who will be ordained in May. “It’s a different world that I live in than people sort of 30 years ago, even 10 years ago.” Eleanor Steinman, senior rabbi of Temple Beth Shalom in Austin, Texas, views the increased diversity as a sign of thriving. “The challenge to the rabbinate is that institutions, including synagogues, are not necessarily totally prepared for that diversity,” said Steinman, who is gay and known for her social justice and LGBTQ+ rights advocacy in the Jewish community. Rabbi Tiferet Berenbaum, director of congregational learning and programming at Temple Beth Zion in Brookline, Massachusetts, recalled how nervous she was during her final year in rabbinical school. Berenbaum, who is Black and has done extensive anti-racism work in the Jewish community, was ordained in 2013. “My Jewish experiences were pretty much all white,” she said. “It was time to go into the job market, and that’s when the voices really started to rise in my head: ‘Who’s going to hire a Black rabbi?’ Not ‘Who’s going to hire a woman rabbi?’” While serving in Wisconsin and New Jersey congregations, she encountered the rabbinate’s patriarchal holdovers, including a lack of accommodations when she became a mother and her husband taking on the “rebbetzin” duties traditionally fulfilled by male rabbis’ wives. “Some of the earlier rabbis were really thrust into the deep patriarchy, where they were accepted but not really accepted, or accepted but forced to mold themselves to a masculine view of what is a rabbi,” said Berenbaum, who is now one of three women rabbis in her congregation. “Whereas now women are able to just bring their full selves.” It’s clear to some rabbinical students that following a career path paved by the female and LGBTQ+ rabbis that came before them has made their own pursuit easier. That’s the case for Sarah Rockford, an LGBTQ+ student at the Conservative movement’s Jewish Theological Seminary in New York. “My leadership is welcome, celebrated, and in some ways not treated as exceptional because of my gender or sexual orientation,” she said. “We tend to forget how quickly things have changed.” Rockford credits strong female mentors for embodying how people from a variety of backgrounds can take on the role, such as Rabbi Rachel Isaacs of Beth Israel Congregation in Waterville, Maine. In 2011, Isaacs became the first openly gay rabbi ordained by the Conservative seminary. “The Jewish community is far more diverse in every sense of the word than the Jewish community I was raised in,” Isaacs said. Many in the rabbinate are drawn to the deeply meaningful and fulfilling work. But it is also demanding. “I love to teach, I love to pastor, I love to lead services. Even funerals — they’re both sad but they’re deeply meaningful. We’re up front and center with the most important moments of people’s lives,” said Felicia Sol, the first woman to serve as senior rabbi in the almost 200-year history of New York’s B’nai Jeshurun synagogue. “Rabbis are being pulled in so many directions and pressured in so many ways that it’s very frustrating and hard.” Some rabbis cite the challenge of holding together congregations during times of heightened political divisions and growing tensions over the Israel-Hamas war. Unsustainable expectations, emotional exhaustion and financial stress are commonplace, according to Atra’s research. “The biggest struggle is burnout,” Isaacs said. “No matter how hard you try, the line or the boundary between the personal and the professional is extraordinarily fuzzy, which makes it very hard to unplug.” Steinman agrees. She felt called to become a rabbi as a teenager, wanting to teach and counsel a Jewish community. But she said it can be overwhelming: “When I tell people that I have one day off a week, they’re shocked.” Rockford, who is preparing to become a rabbi in May, understands the challenges but remains optimistic. “My hope for the rabbinate is that we continue to sort of ride this wave of diversifying the faces of people we look to as teachers, as rabbis and as spiritual leaders,” she said. “The diversity of those voices makes our communities stronger and better prepared to thrive in the next 100 years.” ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

(AP Photo/Andrew Dampf) CORTINA D’AMPEZZO, Italy (AP) — Lindsey Vonn’s father said Monday that the American superstar will no longer race if he has any influence over her decision and that she will not return to the Winter Olympics after breaking her left leg in the downhill over the weekend. “She’s 41 years old and this is the end of her career,” Alan Kildow said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. “There will be no more ski races for Lindsey Vonn, as long as I have anything to say about it.” Kildow and the rest of Vonn’s family — a brother and two sisters — have been with Vonn while she is being treated at a hospital in Treviso following her fall and helicopter evacuation from the course in Cortina on Sunday. Vonn said late Monday on Instagram that she had sustained a “complex tibia fracture that is currently stable but will require multiple surgeries to fix properly.” Lindsey Vonn’s father said Monday that the American superstar will no longer race if he has any influence over her decision and that she will not return to the Winter Olympics after breaking her leg in the downhill over the weekend. Kildow declined to comment on the injuries, but he did address how Vonn was doing emotionally. “She’s a very strong individual,” Kildow said. “She knows physical pain and she understands the circumstances that she finds herself in. And she’s able to handle it. Better than I expected. She’s a very, very strong person. And so I think she’s handling it real well.” Kildow — a former ski racer himself who taught his daughter to race — said he slept in his daughter’s hospital room overnight. “She has somebody with her — or multiple people with her — at all times,” Kildow said. “We’ll have people here as long as she’s here.” Kildow and the rest of Vonn’s family watched the crash from the finish area with all of the other spectators. “First, the shock and the horror of the whole thing, seeing a crash like that,” Kildow said of what he felt watching the scene unfold. “It can be dramatic and traumatic. You’re just horrified at what those kinds of impacts have. “You can go into a shock an emotional psychological shock,” he added. “Because it’s difficult to just accept what’s happened. But she’s well cared for. … And the USOC and the U.S. Ski team have a very, very top-notch doctor with her and she is being very well cared for here in Italy.” Vonn raced the downhill despite tearing the ACL in her left knee nine days earlier in another crash. “What happened to her had nothing to do with the ACL issue on her left leg. Nothing,” Kildow said. “She had demonstrated that she was able to function at a very high level with the two downhill training runs. … And she had been cleared by high level physicians to ski.” Kildow said the crash was less a result of Vonn’s knee injury than the way she pushed the limits of her racing line to the point where she clipped a gate early in her run and got knocked out of control. “There are times sometimes in any race, but especially in downhill, where you have to take a little speed off,” he said. “You can give yourself a little bit more leeway on the line so you don’t put yourself in a questionable position.” Vonn, who holds the record of 12 World Cup victories in Cortina, returned to the circuit last season after nearly six years of retirement and after a partial titanium replacement surgery in her right knee. She won two downhills and finished on the podium in seven of the eight World Cup races that she finished this season — and came fourth in the other one. “She won 84 World Cup races. And not many people do that,” Kildow said, referring to Vonn’s victory total, which place her second on the all-time women’s list behind teammate Mikaela Shiffrin’s record 108 wins. “And there’s a hell of a lot of the difference between a speed race, a downhill especially, and a slalom,” Kildow added. Vonn will not return to the Olympics to cheer on teammates or for anything else, Kildow said. “No, she’s not that in kind of situation,” he said. “She will be going home at an appropriate point in time.” ___ AP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics Copyright 2026 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Ross D. Franklin, File) PHOENIX (AP) — Arizona must stop enforcing abortion restrictions that predate and contradict a 2024 voter-approved constitutional amendment guaranteeing abortion rights, a judge ordered in a ruling released Friday. Maricopa Superior Court Judge Greg Como found that the older laws present unnecessary obstacles to getting an abortion, including barring one if a woman was seeking it because the fetus had a non-fatal genetic abnormality, and requiring patients to see a doctor twice, at least 24 hours apart, before obtaining one. He also took issue with the laws because they required abortion seekers to undergo ultrasounds and Rh blood testing, and barred doctors from prescribing abortion pills by telehealth and mailing them to patients. Pills are the most common way abortion is obtained. “Each of these laws infringe on a woman’s ‘autonomous decision making’ by mandating medical procedures and disclosure of information regardless of the patient’s needs and wishes,” Como wrote. Kris Mayes, the state’s Democratic attorney general, supported the plaintiffs. Two of Arizona’s top legislative Republicans — House Speaker Steve Montenegro and Senate President Warren Petersen — intervened in the lawsuit in support of the restrictions, arguing that abortion rights advocates wanted to sweep away health and safety regulations in the name of the constitutional amendment. Peterson’s office said the ruling will be appealed. In Arizona and many other states, abortion law has been in flux since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and cleared the way for states to ban abortion. Even after voters approved the abortion rights amendment, throwing out a 2022 law that banned abortion after 15 weeks’ gestation, some older restrictions remained on the books. Two obstetricians and the Arizona Medical Association sued last year over the continued enforcement of the old laws. They said the voter-backed constitutional amendment guaranteed the “fundamental right to abortion” and specifically barred the state from enacting, adopting or enforcing a law that “denies, restricts or interferes with that right before fetal viability.” “My patients will no longer be forced to make additional unnecessary visits for care, nor will I be required to give them disinformation that stigmatizes abortion.” Dr. Laura Mercer, an OB-GYN and member of the board at the Arizona Medical Association, said in a statement Friday. Ingrid Duran, the National Right to Life Committee’s state legislative director, told The Associated Press on Friday that she’s disappointed but not surprised by the ruling. She said the group intends to work on educating people in Arizona about its position to “expand our base into more pro-lifers who believe that the unborn child deserves protection.” But she said the group doesn’t expect the ruling to be overturned. Since Roe was overturned, voters in several states have passed laws allowing abortion, while voters in others have rejected such measures. Missouri voters will decide this year whether to overturn a voter-backed amendment guaranteeing abortion rights. ___ Mulvihill reported from Haddonfield, New Jersey.

All Rights Reserved. Copyright 2026 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Stefania Terre, who is blind, uses a small light on her fingers while touching a life-size reproduction of the head of Michelangelo’s David as she poses for a long-exposure photograph at the Omero Tactile Museum in Ancona, Italy, Thursday, Jan. 15, 2026. (AP Photo/Alessandra Tarantino) Alessandra Tarantino has been working with The Associated Press in Italy since 2005. Based in Rome, she mainly covers the Vatican, sports and politics. Here’s what she had to say about this extraordinary photo. Why this photo? I had been wanting to make a story about blindness for a long time, but I couldn’t find the right angle. Then an old friend, Giorgio Guardi, told me about the work he does with his association, Radici, which organizes inclusive tours in Rome, including tours for blind people. I didn’t know much about Radici, so I participated in one of their tours - where blind, deaf and other disabled people visited Rome on a cold November day. It was particularly fascinating to see how blind people touch things, how they move their fingers and how a tour guide leads their hand over the artworks encountered along the tour. The blind people we interviewed explained to us that it’s not just touch, but many elements such as the voice of the guide, scents and the feeling of a more intimate connection with the artwork that help create the so-called tactile image. While I was thinking about how to create a photo that would convey the idea of the tactile image, I remembered a famous series of photos by Gjon Mili, who in the late 40s created a series of portraits of Picasso while he traced some sketches in the air in the form of light trails. The photos were published on LIFE in 1949. How I made this photo I believe that for a sighted person, it is very difficult to imagine how a blind person “sees,” and I thought that with this technique, I could create an image that would give an idea of how hands explore a work of art and how this can be imagined by someone who cannot see. I asked for an opinion on this idea from the head of communications at the Museo Tattile Omero, who put me in touch with Stefania Terre, a blind woman I spoke to about my idea. I told her about Picasso, the genius photographer Mili, and how her connection with art could be transformed into another artistic creation. We met at the Museo Omero, followed Stefania on this tour and then we experimented with “the technique.” We had to wait until the museum closed, and the museum staff turned off all the lights. In a few seconds, we found ourselves immersed in a dense darkness. I had given Stefania a small LED light and had created a little ring with an elastic band for her to wear it on her finger. Stefania began to explore the face, to the natural size of Michelangelo’s David, and I – I had previously set up the camera on a tripod - took a 24-second exposure photo. When I saw the result, I was almost moved; the face of David emerges from the darkness, with Stefania’s face faintly appearing in the background, while at times, a glimpse of her hand can be seen. I took this photo with a long exposure, the camera was set to 50 ISO and was steady on a tripod. The aperture was set to f/16 and the exposure lasted 24 seconds. During the 24 seconds, the shot captured Stefania’s hand as she explored the face of David, with an LED light placed on one of her fingers, which also illuminated the statue. The little light that filtered from outside slightly illuminated her face. Why this photo works I believe this is an intriguing image that can help people see things in a different way. One of the slogans of the Museo Tattile Omero was “Forbidden not to touch,” and how not just sight, but touch, can help us understand and connect with the beauty of art. It’s an unpredictable photo; you can’t really know what will come out, and even though I had done some tests beforehand, the real-life situation is always unpredictable.

Bukaty, File) Graham Platner speaks at an anti-ICE rally outside of Sen. Susan Collins’ Portland office on Thursday, Jan. 29, 2026. (Brianna Soukup /Portland Press Herald via AP) PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — Republican Sen. Susan Collins announced her reelection bid Tuesday, betting that she can hold onto her coveted Maine seat despite a renewed Democratic effort to oust her in a race that could determine control of the U.S. Senate. The campaign will test Collins’ political survival skills. The 73-year-old has won five terms by casting herself as a reflection of Maine’s independent spirit, occasionally clashing with President Donald Trump while also largely supporting his agenda. “I have always worked across the aisle to solve problems. Maine needs experienced, steady leadership that focuses on getting things done,” Collins said in a Tuesday statement. As she seeks a sixth term, Collins faces outrage over immigration enforcement tactics that could become a political liability for Republican candidates across the country. A recent operation in Maine led to hundreds of arrests but also criticism that people were being rounded up even if they didn’t have criminal records. Collins has taken credit for stopping the surge of federal agents in Maine after she spoke directly with Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. However, Democrats accused Collins of not going far enough, pointing to her refusal to call for Noem’s ouster and her vote in favor of a bipartisan Homeland Security funding bill. The party needs to net four seats to retake the Senate majority, and they are aiming to do that in Maine, North Carolina, Alaska and Ohio. Gov. Janet Mills and oyster farmer Graham Platner are among Collins’ top Democratic challengers. While many establishment Democrats and influential left-leaning groups have backed Mills, Platner has gained traction with his anti-establishment image and economic equality message. He’s campaigned aggressively while facing revelations of problematic social media posts and having to cover up a tattoo resembling a Nazi symbol. Mills has accused Collins of governing “without any courage” shortly after the Republican voted in favor of funding the DHS and several other agencies in January. She repeated that charge Tuesday. “Seniority without a backbone is just tenure, and after decades in Washington, Senator Collins has failed to demonstrate the leadership required in this dangerous moment in history,” she said in a statement. Platner has demanded that Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which is part of DHS, be dismantled and said he did not believe Collins or the Trump administration’s promise to leave Maine. He said Tuesday in a post on the social platform X that Collins should have kept her promise to serve just two Senate terms. “That’s just one of a hundred reasons she doesn’t deserve a sixth term,” he wrote. Platner recently outraised both Mills and Collins, according to the latest federal filings. The first-time candidate collected nearly $4.6 million, while Mills raised $2.7 million. Collins, who had not yet officially launched her campaign during the filing period, had more than $8 million in cash on hand at the end of 2025. Collins, who has said she didn’t vote for Trump in 2016, voted to convict the president after his 2021 impeachment over his role in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. After Collins joined a handful of Republican colleagues in backing a failed effort to limit the president’s ability to unilaterally use force in Venezuela, Trump said on social media that they “should never be elected to office again.” But Collins has also broadly backed Trump’s agenda, including his tax and spending bill, and his nominees. Notably, Collins voted to confirm Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as Trump’s choice to be secretary of Health and Human Services. Kennedy has since espoused anti-vaccine policy and ousted public health officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. She has faced down tough challenges before. Democrat Sara Gideon raised $69 million in 2020, outspending Collins in a bid to help take back the Senate during a presidential election year when the Democrats won the top of the ticket. Collins defeated Gideon by more than 8 points. Collins has remained in office despite Maine becoming increasingly blue. The proportion of registered Democrats has increased since her last reelection campaign, when “unenrolled” independent voters outnumbered Democrats in 2019 but now trail them in 2026. Republicans have trailed both groups for years. ___ Kruesi reported from Providence, Rhode Island. Copyright 2026 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.",center,2026-02-10T11:29:39.017061

(AP Photo/Mark Thiessen, File) A huge black bear that made its den in the crawl space under a Los Angeles area man’s house for more than a month has finally been evicted. Altadena resident Ken Johnson said the animal began denning beneath his home around Thanksgiving, twisting gas lines and toppling bricks as he came and went. Surveillance video showed the bear easily tearing away screening and other obstacles and squeezing through a small opening. Johnson said in a phone interview Friday that he first asked state wildlife officials for help, but the air horns and paintball guns they deployed didn’t work. So he turned to BEAR League, a California-based nonprofit that bills itself as specializing in “living in harmony with bears.” The bear was out within about 20 minutes after members from the group arrived, Johnson said. AP’s Lisa Dwyer reports on the eviction of a very large, hairy unwanted guest. In a social media post on Thursday, the group said that one of its most experienced responders crawled beneath the home and got behind the bear — which it estimated weighs more than 500 pounds (227 kilograms) — to encourage the animal to leave. “There’s the relief — it feels like, you know, you had a bunch of dinner guests over and now the party’s over — well it wasn’t a party — but you know they’re gone and now you’ve got a bunch of dirty dishes and empty glasses to deal with,” Johnson said. The group placed an “unwelcome” mat, which delivers an electric shock, at the opening. Video footage showed the bear returning to the house, stepping on the mat and then running away. Dave Fleishman, a BEAR League spokesperson who helped evict the animal, said it was one of the largest black bears he has seen. “He’s in my top three,” Fleishman said. “He’s an old soul ... I think he just wanted a quiet place for the winter,” he added. “But he’d done a tremendous amount of damage to Ken’s house. And so, you don’t want Ken’s house to burn down or the rest of Altadena to burn down because of a ruptured gas line.” Fleishman said the team was able to move the bear quickly because the house has two crawl spaces, making access easier. He called it a “standard eviction” the group regularly handles, particularly in the Lake Tahoe area. Johnson described having the bear around as “unsettling.” Since the eviction, the bear came back at least once before moving on, he said. “It’s just the constant tension of if he if he decides to come out I have to be ready,” he said. Johnson said the animal caused thousands of dollars in damage, which has been particularly tough to deal with because he lost his job after last year’s Eaton wildfire. The bear shredded ductwork under the house and twisted natural gas piping, Johnson said. He’s set up a GoFundMe page seeking to repair the damage and make his house livable again.

All Rights Reserved. Copyright 2026 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. David Geeslin, former superintendent at Indiana School for the Deaf, poses for a portrait Monday, Feb. 2, 2026, in Indianapolis. (Jenna Watson/Mirror Indy via AP) David Geeslin can still remember what it felt like to start learning American Sign Language as a toddler. “My world became much clearer and more colorful,” Geeslin said through an ASL interpreter. “It wasn’t black and white anymore.” Sign language opened up opportunities for Geeslin. When he was 3 years old, he enrolled at Indiana School for the Deaf. After earning his bachelor’s, master’s and doctorate degrees, Geeslin served as superintendent there until retiring in 2025. Now, though, Geeslin and other prominent members of the local Deaf community are concerned that a new master’s program at Butler University will result in fewer deaf kids learning to sign. Butler’s new online master’s program in Deaf education will train future educators how to teach speaking and listening to deaf children, particularly kids who have cochlear implants or use other hearing technology. The new program is funded through a $1.25-million grant from the federal Department of Education. But community members are upset that Butler’s curriculum only includes one ASL class, a one-credit course that teaches basic signs and “stories, poems and readings that exist in Deaf culture.” Jenna Voss, director of the new Butler program, told Mirror Indy that the degree is designed to train teachers who can give children and families options, and that the curriculum’s focus on oral and spoken language does not prevent people from learning ASL separately. “There will be deaf children who sign as their primary way of communicating and connecting with others, and there are deaf children who use hearing technology and use the spoken languages of their family’s homes and hearts,” Voss told Mirror Indy. “We need a workforce that can meet all of those needs.” Research is split on the best way to educate deaf kids — whether that be through listening and spoken language, ASL or a mix of both. What is clear, though, is deaf children are far more likely than hearing children to experience language deprivation. That’s a communication disorder that develops when kids don’t have consistent access to a language — whether ASL or English — as babies and toddlers. Many studies have found that teaching deaf children sign language helps them communicate naturally, even if they will eventually develop the ability to speak or hear using hearing aids or a cochlear implant. Butler’s program, which launches this fall, comes amid changes to sign language programs at Indiana colleges. As part of an effort to cut degrees without a certain number of graduates, IU Indianapolis eliminated its bachelor’s degree in ASL interpreting and is no longer accepting new students. Ball State’s Deaf education program, similarly, is required to merge with other degrees before next school year. After Butler announced the program in mid-January, community members started sending letters to Butler to ask that the university add more ASL classes to the curriculum. The letter campaign was organized by the Indiana Association of the Deaf. “Some (deaf people) speak better than they sign, some sign better than they speak,” Geoffrey Bignell, director of advocacy for Indiana Association of the Deaf, said through an interpreter. “It’s very diverse, so providing everything is best, rather than limiting a professional who is going to be working in this environment.” Christine Multra Kraft became deaf when she was 4 years old. Because she had already learned to speak English, Kraft’s parents encouraged her to keep that skill as the family adjusted. But she struggled — until she started signing. “I picked it up so quickly,” Kraft said through an ASL interpreter. “I was able to be back to myself.” So when Kraft saw that Butler’s program would focus solely on spoken language, she was upset at what she saw as an attempt to force kids to speak rather than learn a language that comes more naturally to them. “That perspective out there is that it’s like, oh, they need to be fixed,” Kraft said. “Sign language, there’s no failure there. It’s helping people grow as an individual, as a person.” For many deaf people, though, there’s a fear that spoken language programs are repeating history. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, sign language was banned in many Deaf schools, and children were required to attempt to speak and read lips. This mindset started to shift in the 1960s, when scholars recognized ASL as a language. But an official decree that banned sign language was not officially redacted until 2010. So, when Bonnie Conner heard about Butler’s new program, her thought was — “not again.” While she’s not against deaf people learning to speak, she’s upset that future teachers of the deaf wouldn’t be required to learn ASL. “Why don’t hearing people listen to deaf people?” Bonnie Conner, who is chair of Vincennes’ ASL and Deaf culture program, asked through an interpreter. “Why don’t they listen to what they already know, their experiences? How can hearing people ever live in our shoes? “They can’t. They never will, so at least they could understand our experiences and what we know from our experience.” As with the research, parents too are often split on whether teaching sign or spoken language to their deaf children is the correct approach. Perhaps that’s unsurprising, given that over 90% of deaf children are born to hearing parents. According to a 2013 survey from Gallaudet University, the nation’s preeminent Deaf college, less than a quarter of families with deaf children regularly use sign language at home. Brooklyn Lowery, whose 7-year-old daughter Salem is deaf, is happy more future teachers will be trained to help kids listen and speak. While Lowery said she’d be supportive if her daughter wants to learn more ASL, she’s excelling at her IPS school now. Giving families the option to choose, Lowery thinks, is important. “Most people have no idea until they see her hearing aids that she has any difficulty at all hearing what’s going on around her,” Lowery said. “She just adapted beautifully to that situation.” The new program at Butler is one of just five Deaf education programs in the country with a focus on spoken language, according to the program’s website. The program is a continuation of a long-running program at Fontbonne University near St. Louis, which closed last August. In response to concerns from the Deaf community regarding sign language, Voss told Mirror Indy that Butler offers ASL as a foreign language for undergraduate students and is adding an ASL minor, which will also be launching in the fall. These classes won’t be part of the master’s program, though. Rather, Voss said, the new degree curriculum will help students who want to pursue a career specifically in helping deaf kids learn listening and speaking skills. “I think there are some people that would suggest every practitioner in our field needs to be able to do all the things,” she said. “I pragmatically and practically think that there is a space for specialization.” ___ Claire Rafford covers higher education for Mirror Indy in partnership with Open Campus ___ This story was originally published by Mirror Indy and distributed through a partnership with The Associated Press.

Bad Bunny performs during halftime of the NFL Super Bowl 60 football game between the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks, Sunday, Feb. 8, 2026, in Santa Clara, Calif. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel) The morning after the Seahawks became Super Bowl champions, people spent Monday trying to figure out who had won the other widely talked about competition of the night: Dueling halftime performances between Bad Bunny and conservative darling Kid Rock. Nielsen figures won’t be released until Tuesday on how many people tuned in to watch Bad Bunny, a U.S. citizen born in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico and the NFL’s superstar performer. Most years the show attracts more than 100 million viewers. The conservative organization Turning Point USA arranged the competing performance, and spokesperson Andrew Kolvet told Fox News host Brian Kilmeade on Sunday evening that “at one point” roughly 10 million people were watching the Kid Rock show live across all social media platforms. The organization didn’t release exact figures when asked on Monday morning, though at one point roughly 5 million people were watching the show live on YouTube. The race to capture national attention during the most widely watched event in the U.S. has been cast as a competition to define the country given that Turning Point organized its performance with President Donald Trump’s blessing to protest the NFL picking the star from Puerto Rico as its headliner. The performances come at a polarizing time in the U.S., with stark lines drawn between proponents of Trump’s immigration policies and the people opposing large-scale immigration crack downs in American cities. Within weeks of the Super Bowl, two white Americans citizens were killed by federal agents in Minneapolis, a city that was last in the global spotlight during protests over the murder of George Floyd. Bad Bunny has been a vocal and outspoken opponent of ICE, although he made no mention of the agency during his performance. Kid Rock is one of the president’s highest profile celebrity allies. The “All American Halftime Show” headlined by Kid Rock, included a video and photo tribute to the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was fatally shot last year on a Utah college campus. The program lasted roughly 30 minutes and also featured country musicians Brantley Gilbert, Gabby Barrett and Lee Brice. Several performers declared that the alternative show represented “the real America,” while Kolvet told Fox News that the viewership amounted to a “massive” success. “People are paying attention,” he said. The TPUSA show also aired on numerous right-leaning broadcast networks, including OAN News and Trinity Broadcasting Network. The 10 million viewers Kolvet estimated tuned in would be dwarfed by previous Super Bowl viewership. Kendrick Lamar set the record with 133.5 million viewers of his 2025 halftime show, topping Usher’s 2024 performance that drew 123.4 million. Here’s a breakdown of the Easter eggs hidden in plain view during the 13-minute set. Bad Bunny, born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio and who became the most streamed artist of 2025, brought unabashedly Puerto Rican culture to Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California. His theme was unity and he danced and sang across the field under a screen reading “The only thing more powerful than hate is love.” Many songs he performed showcased his 2025 album “Debí Tirar Más Fotos,” the first all-Spanish album to win a Grammy for album of the year. The show didn’t shy away from Puerto Rico’s most pressing political inequalities, and included direct references to the island’s chronic power outages and the fight for sovereignty from the United States. Trump, who skipped the Super Bowl and said he wouldn’t watch Bad Bunny’s performance, called Sunday’s halftime show “one of the worst, EVER” in a post on Truth Social. “It makes no sense, is an affront to the Greatness of America, and doesn’t represent our standards of Success, Creativity, or Excellence,” Trump wrote. “This ‘Show’ is just a ‘slap in the face’ to our Country, which is setting new standards and records every single day.” Copyright 2026 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Matias Delacroix, File) LA GUAIRA, VENEZUELA (AP) — Matias Delacroix is a Chilean-raised photojournalist currently based in Panama who has been photographing the U.S. attack in Venezuela and its aftermath. Here’s what he had to say about this extraordinary photo. Why I shot this photo When I saw an armed woman riding on the back of a motorcycle, it immediately reminded me of a well-known photograph from the 1990s by a Chilean photographer showing a woman with a submachine gun. That visual echo made me pause. I was seeing a similar image resurface decades later, this time in Caracas and under very different circumstances. In the aftermath of U.S. strikes that ended with the capture of President Nicolás Maduro, groups of pro-government civilians took to the streets, some armed. The scene reflected the shock and uncertainty that followed the attack, and photographing it felt essential. How I made this photo I took the photo at a gas station guarded by armed civilians and police. A small group of motorcyclists arrived carrying weapons; some were young, others much older. They questioned who I was and what I was doing there. After I explained that I was an international news agency photographer covering the aftermath of the U.S. bombing, they allowed me to continue working. I had been working nonstop since the strikes. At dawn, after coordinating with the photo editor, we decided to expand coverage beyond Caracas to follow reports of damage at the port of La Guaira. I moved by motorcycle, like the armed patrols in the image, to reach locations quickly and to be able to leave fast if the situation escalated. Why it works The photo condenses a tense moment into a single frame: armed civilians occupying public space, motorcycles symbolizing speed and control, and a woman carrying a weapon — a detail that immediately draws attention. It captures how, in the hours after the strikes, the line between civilian life and armed response blurred, conveying instability and fear without the need for explanation.

(AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall, File) SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Wednesday he was blocking Louisiana’s attempt to extradite a doctor in the Golden State accused of mailing abortion pills. The Democratic governor’s announcement comes a day after Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, a Republican, said he sent the extradition paperwork in an effort to bring the physician “to justice.” Louisiana has some of the strictest anti-abortion laws in the country, while California law aims to protect abortion providers from criminal prosecution for treating out-of-state patients. Newsom said extraditing the doctor would have violated an executive order he signed in 2022 barring state agencies in his administration from assisting other states’ efforts to prosecute abortion providers. “We will not allow extremist politicians from other states to reach into California and try to punish doctors based on allegations that they provided reproductive health care services,” he said in a statement. “Not today. Not ever.” Landry’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Newsom’s announcement. Louisiana was pushing to extradite Remy Coeytaux, a physician in the San Francisco Bay Area. Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said Tuesday Coeytaux faced a criminal charge of abortion by means of abortion-inducing drugs and risked spending up to 50 years in jail if convicted. An email and a telephone message seeking comment from Coeytaux Tuesday on the extradition push went unanswered. Copyright 2026 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved. Copyright 2026 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Un rompehielos le abre camino a un buque carguero con un iceberg al fondo en las inmediaciones de un puerto en la isla Alexandra Land, el 17 de mayo de 2021, cerca de Nagurskoye, Rusia. (AP Foto/Alexander Zemlianichenko, archivo) REIKIAVIK, Islandia (AP) — A medida que el incremento de las temperaturas globales acelera el derretimiento del hielo marino en el océano Ártico, se ha desencadenado un auge de barcos que toman rutas que antes eran intransitables por estar congeladas. El aumento del tránsito marítimo en el Ártico, que recibió mayor atención luego de que el presidente estadounidense Donald Trump presionó para que Estados Unidos se apodere de Groenlandia, ha tenido un enorme costo ambiental: el carbono negro, u hollín, que emana de los buques y acelera aún más el derretimiento del hielo. En reuniones celebradas esta semana con reguladores internacionales del transporte marítimo, varios países abogan para que los navíos utilicen combustibles más limpios que emitan menos contaminantes en ese océano. Los glaciares, la nieve y el hielo cubiertos de hollín emitido por los barcos tienen menos capacidad para reflejar la luz solar y, por el contrario, absorben más el calor del Sol, lo que contribuye a hacer del Ártico el lugar de la Tierra que se calienta más rápido. A su vez, el derretimiento del hielo marino de dicha región puede afectar patrones climáticos en diversas partes del mundo. “Esto deriva en un ciclo interminable de incremento en el calentamiento”, advirtió Sian Prior, asesora principal de la Clean Arctic Alliance, una coalición de organizaciones sin fines de lucro centrada en el Ártico y el transporte marítimo. “Necesitamos regular las emisiones, en particular el hollín. Ambos están completamente desregulados en el Ártico”. En diciembre, Francia, Alemania, las Islas Salomón y Dinamarca propusieron que la Organización Marítima Internacional exigiera a los buques que navegan por aguas del Ártico que utilicen “combustibles polares”, los cuales son más ligeros y emiten menos contaminación de hollín que los combustibles marítimos de uso generalizado, conocidos como fuelóleos residuales. La propuesta incluye las medidas que las empresas deberían adoptar para cumplir y demostrar que utilizan combustibles más limpios, así como el área geográfica en la que se aplicaría: a todos los buques que naveguen al norte del paralelo 60. Se prevé que la propuesta sea presentada esta semana al Comité de Prevención y Respuesta a la Contaminación de la OMI, y posiblemente a otro comité en abril. La prohibición del uso en el Ártico de un tipo de fuelóleo residual conocido como fuelóleo pesado —en vigor a partir de 2024— ha tenido un impacto modesto hasta la fecha, en parte debido a lagunas legales. El impulso para reducir el hollín, cuyo impacto en el calentamiento global es 1.600 veces mayor que el del dióxido de carbono en un período de 20 años, según estudios, ocurre en un momento de conflicto de intereses, tanto a nivel internacional como entre los países con costas en el Ártico. En los últimos meses, los comentarios periódicos de Trump sobre la necesidad de “poseer” Groenlandia para reforzar la seguridad de Estados Unidos han desatado cuestionamientos sobre diversos temas, desde la soberanía de esa isla enorme hasta el futuro de la OTAN. Mientras tanto, la contaminación y otros problemas ambientales en el Ártico han quedado relegados a un segundo plano. Trump, quien ha calificado el cambio climático como “un engaño”, también se ha opuesto a las políticas globales destinadas a combatirlo. El año pasado, se tenía previsto que la OMI adoptara nuevas regulaciones que habrían impuesto tasas de carbono al transporte marítimo, lo que, según sus partidarios, habría impulsado a las empresas a utilizar combustibles más limpios y electrificar sus flotas de ser posible. Entonces Trump intervino y presionó firmemente para que las naciones votaran en contra. La medida se pospuso un año, y sus perspectivas, en el mejor de los casos, son inciertas. Por ello, es difícil que la OMI avance rápidamente en la propuesta actual para limitar el hollín en el Ártico. Incluso en las naciones limítrofes con ese océano —que son las más afectadas por el carbono negro y otros tipos de contaminación procedente del transporte marítimo— existen tensiones internas en torno a estas regulaciones. Islandia es un buen ejemplo. Si bien el país es un líder mundial en tecnologías verdes como la captura de carbono y el uso de energía térmica para la calefacción, los ambientalistas dicen que ha avanzado menos en la regulación de la contaminación en sus mares. Esto se debe a que su industria pesquera, una de las más importantes de la nación, tiene una influencia enorme. “La industria está feliz con las ganancias, descontenta con los impuestos, y no se involucra en temas como el clima ni la biodiversidad”, expresó Arni Finnsson, presidente de la junta directiva de la Asociación Islandesa para la Conservación de la Naturaleza. Finnsson reportó que los costos de utilizar combustibles más limpios o electrificar las flotas también han generado resistencia. “Creo que el gobierno está despertando, pero aún tienen que esperar a que la industria (pesquera) diga que sí”, agregó. El país no se ha pronunciado en torno a la propuesta pendiente sobre los combustibles polares. En un comunicado, el Ministerio de Medio Ambiente, Energía y Clima de Islandia expresó que la propuesta era “positiva en cuanto a su propósito y contenido básico”, pero que se requerían más estudios. El comunicado añadió que Islandia respalda medidas más enérgicas para contrarrestar las emisiones del transporte marítimo y reducir el hollín. La contaminación por hollín se ha incrementado en el Ártico a medida que buques de carga, barcos pesqueros e incluso algunos cruceros navegan con mayor frecuencia por las aguas que conectan las zonas más septentrionales de Islandia, Groenlandia, Canadá, Rusia, Noruega, Finlandia, Suecia y Estados Unidos. Entre 2013 y 2023, la cantidad de barcos que entraron en aguas al norte del paralelo 60 aumentó 37%, según el Consejo Ártico, un foro intergubernamental compuesto por los ocho países limítrofes con ese océano. En ese mismo período, la distancia total recorrida por buques allí se incrementó 111%. Las emisiones de hollín también han aumentado. En 2019, se emitieron 2.696 toneladas de carbono negro desde barcos al norte del paralelo 60, en comparación con las 3.310 toneladas de 2024, según un estudio de Energy and Environmental Research Associates, una empresa de consultoría para desarrollar soluciones a retos donde confluyen el uso de la energía y el medio ambiente. El estudio concluyó que los barcos pesqueros eran la mayor fuente de hollín. Encontró también que la prohibición del fuelóleo pesado, de 2024, sólo resultaría en una pequeña reducción del carbono negro. Las excepciones y exenciones permiten que algunos buques continúen utilizándolo hasta 2029. Grupos ambientalistas y los países interesados consideran que regular el combustible para buques es la única manera realista de reducir el hollín. Esto se debe a que lograr que las naciones acuerden limitar el tráfico probablemente sea imposible, ya que el atractivo de la pesca, la extracción de recursos y la reducción en las distancias de navegación es demasiado grande. Los barcos pueden ahorrar días en algunos viajes entre Asia y Europa si cruzan por el Ártico. No obstante, la llamada “ruta marítima del Norte” sólo es transitable unos cuantos meses al año, e incluso entonces los barcos deben ir acompañados de rompehielos. Esos peligros, sumados a la preocupación por la contaminación del Ártico, han motivado a algunas empresas a comprometerse a mantenerse alejadas de ese océano, al menos por ahora. “El debate en torno al Ártico se está intensificando, y el transporte marítimo comercial forma parte de esa discusión”, escribió Søren Toft —director general de la Mediterranean Shipping Company, la empresa de transporte de contenedores más grande del mundo— en una publicación en LinkedIn el mes pasado. “Nuestra postura en MSC es clara. No utilizamos ni utilizaremos la ruta marítima del Norte”. ——- La cobertura climática y ambiental de The Associated Press recibe el apoyo económico de varias fundaciones privadas.

AP News,https://apnews.com/article/workers-right-sit-standing-retail-unions-43ba3e9e36a2604c1b6ed9dc594e3b79,Is spending all day on your feet at work an occupational hazard?,"Copyright 2026 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Copyright 2026 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. AP Illustration / Annie Ng NEW YORK (AP) — As a citizen of both France and America, Margaux Lantelme has noticed a difference in how store cashiers work in the two countries: in France, they do their jobs sitting down. In the U.S., where Lantelme works a register at REI, cashiers typically spend eight hours a day on their feet. For Lantelme, a former kayaking instructor, prolonged standing can trigger flare-ups of chronic pain that limit her mobility. She requested a chair to use during her shift and got one. But after a change in management, she had to fill out paperwork to keep the chair, which required multiple doctor visits and insurance co-payments over a period of months. She’s still waiting for final approval. “Not having access to a chair without approval from a doctor, which costs money and time and energy, is really ridiculous,” Lantelme said. “I personally think that people should be able to have access to seating at work anytime they need it.” Standing for long periods can lead to low back pain, fatigue, muscle pain and leg swelling, and it can increase the risk of cardiovascular problems and pregnancy complications, according to a review conducted by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Researchers there concluded that movement, whether walking or shifting from a standing to a seated or leaning position, appeared to be the best way of reducing those health hazards. Being on one’s feet for an extended time also can lead to chronic venous insufficiency, a disease in which damaged veins impact blood circulation, according to the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses, which represents operating room nurses. The association recommends trying “fatigue-reducing techniques such as alternate propping one foot on a footstool, the use of anti-fatigue mats, using a sit-stand stool and wearing supportive footwear,” said Lisa Spruce, senior director of evidence-based perioperative practices at AORN. Many jobs besides nursing require extended standing: department store sales clerks, hairdressers, surgeons, restaurant cooks and airport workers are just some of the people who perform their roles on their feet. Cecilia Ortiz, 43, used to work as an airport wheelchair attendant in Phoenix. “It takes a really hard toll on the knees,” she said. The break room had three or four chairs, which wasn’t enough for everyone, so workers often went to the hallway and sat on the floor, Ortiz said. She said she once got written up by her boss for sitting down at an electronic device charging station for 15 minutes after she’d been on her feet for five hours without a break. This article is part of AP’s Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health.  Be Well. Ortiz now works for a warehouse that provides supplies to the airport, and when she needs to sit, she can. “It’s not so strict over there. If we needed to sit down for any reason there wouldn’t be a problem,” Ortiz said. Her former employer, Prospect Airport Services, said it adheres to all local, state and federal labor regulations regarding breaks. “Our employees are welcome to take their breaks and meals in our designated break room or in any common-use space throughout the airport,” company spokesperson Jackie Reedy said. “This policy allows our employees to choose the location that best suits their needs.” Unionized workers at the Barnes & Nobles store in Manhattan’s Union Square have made access to chairs and the right to sit down under certain conditions a part of their negotiations for their first contract. “The longer I’ve been at the job, I’ve started noticing knee issues, especially because we do a lot of bending down and standing back up when we’re shelving books and showing customers things and creating displays,” bookseller Bear Spiegel, 28, said. “Being able to have a stool available would be really useful just so I could rest my knees for a couple of minutes throughout the day while I’m doing things on the computer while I’m at the registers.” Spiegel’s coworkers suggested wearing a knee brace and athletic tape, and those solutions have helped, but it’s hard for him to predict what days he’ll need the extra support because his symptoms vary each day, he said. “There have been days that I’ve requested a stool and thankfully my managers have allowed me to take them out and use them when needed,” Spiegel said. Barnes & Noble uses chairs or stools routinely for those working off the sales floor when it’s sensible to do so, but a lot of a bookseller’s work is done on the move, including unpacking, sorting and shelving books, a company spokesperson said. The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which represents about 100,000 workers, has been pushing to include in the contracts it negotiates, including at Barnes & Noble, a guaranteed right to sit during work that can be done seated, said Stuart Appelbaum, the union’s president. During one bargaining session, an employer objected to the demand. Union negotiators used a break that emptied the conference room to underline their position. “The employer came back and saw we had removed all chairs from the negotiating table,” Appelbaum said. “I think the point was made.” In the end, the union got the chairs it wanted written into the contract, he said. Around the turn of the 20th century, most states in the U.S. had laws requiring seating for female workers. Women were increasingly entering the workforce, and there was a fear that if their jobs were too physically taxing, they might not become pregnant, said Eileen Boris, a labor historian and professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Women were seen as the “mothers of the human race, and thus we have to protect motherhood,” Boris added. “Almost every state had laws, but they weren’t enforced.” Those laws were repealed over time because they applied only to women. One reason was that the women’s movement was pushing for equal rights, rather than special treatment, Boris said. Labor movements in other countries were more successful in establishing requirements about seating. “The English shop movement was much stronger and had more men in it than the U.S.,” Boris said. In 1964, the International Labour Organization, a U.N. agency, adopted workplace standards requiring employers to furnish sufficient and suitable seats, as well as reasonable opportunities for workers to use them. More than 50 countries ratified the agreement, but the U.S. was not one of them. Today, California, Florida, Massachusetts, Montana, New Jersey, Oregon and Wisconsin are among the states with “right to sit” laws that obligate employers to provide suitable seating for all workers, regardless of gender, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The city of Ann Arbor, Michigan, approved an ordinance in October that requires manufacturers, retail stores, laundromats, hotels, restaurants, hairdressers, barbers and skin care professionals to let workers sit down as along as sitting doesn’t interfere with their duties. A statewide bill also was introduced in Michigan last fall. ___ Have you overcome an obstacle or made a profound change in your work? Send your questions and story ideas to [email protected].

All Rights Reserved. Copyright 2026 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Una centra eléctrica de carbón se ve desde un tren de Beijing a Shenyang en el noroeste de China, el 3 de enero de 2026. (AP Foto/Ng Han Guan) BEIJING (AP) — A pesar de que la expansión de la energía solar y eólica de China avanzó rápidamente en 2025, el gigante asiático abrió muchas más termoeléctricas a carbón de las que había abierto en años recientes, lo que generó preocupación sobre si el mayor emisor del mundo reducirá lo suficiente las emisiones de dióxido de carbono para limitar el cambio climático. En 2025 se pusieron en marcha más de 50 grandes unidades de carbón —conjuntos individuales de calderas y turbinas con una capacidad de generación de un gigavatio o más— en comparación con menos de 20 al año durante la década anterior, según un informe de investigación publicado el martes. Dependiendo del uso de energía, un gigavatio puede abastecer desde varios cientos de miles hasta más de 2 millones de hogares. En general, China añadió 78 gigavatios de nueva capacidad de energía de carbón, un aumento pronunciado respecto a años anteriores, según el informe conjunto del Centro de Investigación sobre Energía y Aire Limpio, que estudia la contaminación del aire y sus impactos, y Global Energy Monitor, que desarrolla bases de datos que rastrean tendencias energéticas. “La escala de la construcción es asombrosa”, afirmó Christine Shearer, coautora del informe de Global Energy Monitor. “Tan sólo en 2025, China comisionó más capacidad de energía de carbón que India en toda la última década”. Al mismo tiempo, adiciones aún mayores de capacidad eólica y solar redujeron la participación del carbón en la generación total de energía el año pasado. La energía proveniente del carbón cayó alrededor del 1% ya que el crecimiento en fuentes de energía más limpias cubrió todo el aumento en la demanda de electricidad el año pasado. China añadió 315 gigavatios de capacidad fotovoltaica y 119 gigavatios de energía eólica en 2025, según estadísticas de la Administración Nacional de Energía del gobierno. El enorme crecimiento en energía eólica y solar plantea la pregunta: ¿Por qué China sigue construyendo termoeléctricas a carbón y, según la mayoría de los análisis, muchas más de las que realmente necesita? La respuesta es complicada. China está en una etapa de desarrollo más temprana que Estados Unidos o Europa, por lo que necesita más energía para seguir creciendo. Si más de los 1.400 millones de habitantes del país ascienden a la clase media, más personas podrán permitirse aires acondicionados y lavadoras. Se necesita electricidad para mantener las fábricas de China en funcionamiento y para satisfacer las altas demandas de energía de la inteligencia artificial, una prioridad del gobierno mientras busca hacer del país un líder en tecnología. El desabastecimiento de energía en partes de China en 2021 y 2022 reforzó las viejas preocupaciones sobre la seguridad energética. Algunas fábricas detuvieron temporalmente la producción y una ciudad impuso apagones rotativos. La respuesta del gobierno fue señalar que quería más termoeléctricas de carbón, lo que llevó a un aumento en las solicitudes y permisos para su construcción. Ese aumento de 2022-2023 impulsó el gran salto en capacidad el año pasado a medida que las nuevas unidades entraron en operación, dijo Qi Qin, analista del Centro de Investigación sobre Energía y Aire Limpio y otra coautora del informe. “Una vez que se emiten los permisos, los proyectos son difíciles de revertir”, expresó. La construcción comenzó en 83 gigavatios de energía de carbón el año pasado, según el informe, lo que sugiere que una gran cantidad de nueva capacidad podría entrar en línea este año. La posición del gobierno es que el carbón proporciona un respaldo estable a fuentes como el viento y el sol, que se ven afectadas por el clima y la hora del día. La escasez en 2022 derivó en parte de una sequía que afectó a la energía hidroeléctrica, una fuente de energía importante en el oeste de China. El carbón debería “jugar un papel importante de apoyo y equilibrio” en los años venideros, dijo la Comisión Nacional de Desarrollo y Reforma, la principal agencia de planificación económica, en una guía emitida el año pasado sobre cómo hacer que las plantas de carbón sean más limpias y eficientes. La Asociación de Transporte y Distribución de Carbón de China, un grupo de la industria, dijo la semana pasada que la energía generada por carbón seguiría siendo esencial para la estabilidad del sistema eléctrico, incluso cuando otras fuentes de energía la reemplacen. El riesgo de construir tanta capacidad de carbón es que podría retrasar la transición a fuentes de energía más limpias, dijo Qin. La presión política y financiera podría mantener las plantas en funcionamiento, dejando menos espacio para otras fuentes de energía, manifestó. El informe instó a China a acelerar el retiro de plantas de carbón envejecidas e ineficientes y a comprometerse en su próximo plan quinquenal, que se aprobará en marzo, a garantizar que las emisiones del sector eléctrico no aumenten entre 2025 y 2030. “Si la expansión de la energía de carbón en China finalmente se traduce en mayores emisiones dependerá de... si el papel de la energía de carbón está realmente limitado a respaldo y apoyo en lugar de generación de carga base”, dijo Qin. ___ La periodista de video de Associated Press Olivia Zhang contribuyó a este despacho. ___ La cobertura climática y ambiental de Associated Press recibe apoyo financiero de múltiples fundaciones privadas.

(AP Photo/Julio Cortez) Social media users incorrectly identified a small boy who was part of Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl halftime show on Sunday as Liam Conejo Ramos, the 5-year-old who, along with his father, was detained by immigration officials in Minnesota and held at an U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Texas. The boy was actually Lincoln Fox Ramadan, a child actor from Costa Mesa, California, who is also 5 years old, according to his Instagram profile. After Bad Bunny finished his song “NUEVAYoL,” cameras showed Lincoln watching Bad Bunny accepting his Grammy for album of the year last week. The artist then walks over and hands Lincoln what appears to be a Grammy. Here’s a closer look at the facts. CLAIM: Bad Bunny handed his Grammy to Liam Conejo Ramos during his Super Bowl halftime performance. THE FACTS: This is false. The boy was child actor Lincoln Fox Ramadan. “An emotional, unforgettable day being cast as the young Benito — a symbolic moment where the future hands the past a Grammy,” reads a Monday post on Lincoln’s Instagram profile. “A reminder that dreams come true and it’s never too early to dream big.” The post includes photos from Lincoln’s appearance during the halftime show and other moments from the day, as well as a childhood photo of Bad Bunny, whose real name is Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio. In the caption, Lincoln also wrote that he’s “sending love to Liam Ramos” and that “we all deserve peace and love in America, a country built by and home to so many hard-working immigrants.” Another post from Lincoln’s Instagram, shared on Sunday, included a video of his cameo and was captioned, “I’ll remember this day forever! @badbunnypr - it was my truest honor.” His last post before the Super Bowl, on Jan. 31, was a photo of himself captioned: “I booked a cool gig! Can’t wait to share it with you guys.” Liam and his father, Adrian Conejo Arias, who is originally from Ecuador, were detained by immigration officers in a Minneapolis suburb on Jan. 20. They were taken to an ICE detention facility in Dilley, Texas, but returned to Minneapolis on Feb. 1 following a judge’s order. Images of immigration officers surrounding the young boy in a blue bunny hat and Spider-Man backpack drew outrage about the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in Minneapolis. Columbia Heights Public Schools, Liam’s school district, confirmed that he was not the boy in Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl halftime show. ”(Superintendent Zena) Stenvik has indicated that the child is not Liam. Liam and his family are sequestered during this time,” CHPS spokesperson Kristen Stuenkel said in a statement Monday. Lincoln, the child actor, is half Egyptian and half Argentine, according to his Instagram and his acting profile. He previous work has included modeling for Walmart and Target. Bad Bunny has won six total Grammys, including three at the 2026 awards show. His album of the year win for the critically-acclaimed “DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS,” is the first time a Spanish-language album has taken home the top prize.

All Rights Reserved. Copyright 2026 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. FILE -The entrance to Florida State Prison in Starke, Fla. is shown Thursday, Aug. 3, 2023. (AP Photo/Curt Anderson) STARKE, Fla. (AP) — A man convicted of killing a traveling salesman during a robbery is set to be executed Tuesday evening in the first lethal injection this year in Florida. Ronald Palmer Heath, 64, is scheduled to receive a three-drug injection starting at 6 p.m. at Florida State Prison near Starke. Heath was convicted in 1990 of first-degree murder, robbery with a deadly weapon and other charges in the killing of Michael Sheridan the previous year. The state’s first scheduled execution of 2026 follows a record 19 executions in Florida last year. Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis oversaw more executions in a single year in 2025 than any other Florida governor since the death penalty was reinstated in the U.S. in 1976. The previous record was eight executions in 2014. According to court records, Heath and his brother Kenneth Heath met Sheridan at a Gainesville bar in May 1989. After hanging out at the bar for some time, the three men agreed to go somewhere else to smoke marijuana. At some point, the brothers plotted to rob the other man, investigators said. Ronald Heath drove the group to a remote area, where Kenneth Heath pulled a handgun on Sheridan. The man initially refused to give the brothers anything, and Kenneth Heath shot Sheridan in the chest. As Sheridan emptied his pockets, Ronald Heath began kicking the man and stabbing him with a hunting knife, prosecutors said. Kenneth Heath then shot Sheridan twice in the head. The brothers dumped Sheridan’s body in a wooded area and returned to the Gainesville bar to take items from his rental car, according to the court record. It said the brothers made multiple purchases with Sheridan’s credit cards the next day at a Gainesville mall. Ronald Heath was arrested several weeks later at his home in Douglas, Georgia, after investigators connected him to the stolen credit cards. Officers recovered clothing purchased with the stolen cards, as well as Sheridan’s watch, according to court records. Kenneth Heath was also charged with Sheridan’s murder, but was sentenced to life in prison as part of a plea agreement. The Florida Supreme Court denied appeals filed by Ronald Heath last week. His attorneys had argued that Florida corrections officials had mismanaged its own death penalty protocols, that the state’s secretive clemency process blocked due process, that Heath’s incarceration as a juvenile stunted his brain development and that jurors did not recommend the death penalty unanimously. Heath still has similar appeals pending before the U.S. Supreme Court. A total of 47 people were executed in the U.S. in 2025. Florida led the way with a flurry of death warrants signed by DeSantis. Alabama, South Carolina and Texas tied for second with five executions each that year. Two more Florida executions have already been scheduled for later this month and next month. Melvin Trotter, 65, is scheduled to die on Feb. 24, and the execution of Billy Leon Kearse, 53, is set to follow exactly a week later on March 3. All Florida executions are carried out via lethal injection using a sedative, a paralytic and a drug that stops the heart, according to the Department of Corrections.

All Rights Reserved. Copyright 2026 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Tulsi Gabbard listens to President Donald Trump as she is sworn in as the Director of National Intelligence in the Oval Office of the White House, Feb. 12, 2025, in Washington. (Photo/Alex Brandon, File) WASHINGTON (AP) — The general counsel for Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard on Monday warned the attorney for an anonymous government employee not to directly share a top-secret complaint about Gabbard’s handling of classified material with members of Congress. The letter to attorney Andrew Bakaj is the latest escalation in the back-and-forth accusations over the classified complaint, which alleges that Gabbard withheld top-secret material for political reasons. Two inspectors general for the intelligence community reviewed the claim and found that particular allegation did not appear to be credible. Gabbard has denied any wrongdoing and said she did all she could to ensure the report reached Congress. Democrats on the House and Senate intelligence committees have blasted Gabbard’s office over the handling of the complaint, questioning why it took eight months for it to be sent to select members of Congress as required by law. Here’s what to know about the complaint and the next steps: The anonymous author of the complaint works for a U.S. intelligence agency and in May filed a report claiming that Gabbard withheld classified information for political reasons. Gabbard oversees the coordination of 18 intelligence agencies. The complaint made two allegations, according to a memo sent to lawmakers by the current inspector general, Christopher Fox: The first is that the “distribution of a highly classified intelligence report was restricted for political purposes,” while the second accuses Gabbard’s general counsel of failing to report a potential crime to the Justice Department. In June, the inspector general at the time, Tamara Johnson, found that the claim Gabbard distributed classified information along political lines did not appear to be credible, Fox said in the memo to lawmakers. Johnson was “unable to assess the apparent credibility” of the accusation about the general counsel’s office, Fox wrote. The watchdog said he would have deemed the complaint non-urgent, meaning it never would have been referred to lawmakers. “If the same or similar matter came before me today, I would likely determine that the allegations do not meet the statutory definition of ‘urgent concern,’” Fox wrote. The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and other news outlets reported that the complaint stemmed from a call between two foreign nationals that mentioned someone close to President Donald Trump and was intercepted by the National Security Agency. The news reports, which cited anonymous sources, said the discussion involved Iran and that Gabbard notified the White House personally, while the complaint accused her of blocking the NSA from reporting the interaction to other agencies. The AP could not immediately confirm the reports. The NSA declined to offer details about the complaint Monday, saying in a statement that it works closely with the FBI and others to investigate the mishandling or disclosure of classified information. Bakaj, a former CIA officer and an attorney for the person making the complaint, offered to meet with certain lawmakers or their staffs to discuss the allegations and his concerns about Gabbard’s review. ODNI’s general counsel warned against that in its letter Monday, noting that Bakaj or his client could face criminal charges if they improperly revealed classified material during the briefing. “The highly classified nature of the underlying complaint increases the risk that you or your client inadvertently or otherwise breaks the law by divulging or mishandling classified information,” the general counsel’s office wrote. “You may have other means of appearing in front of Congress, but this is not it.” Bakaj did not immediately respond to questions Monday about the letter. Under federal law, intelligence whistleblowers are entitled to ask to refer their complaints directly to key lawmakers even if the inspector general finds them non-credible, so long as they deem the allegations urgent. That determination was made by the original watchdog, but the complaint didn’t reach lawmakers until last week. Copies of the top-secret complaint were hand-delivered beginning last week to the “Gang of Eight” — a group comprised of the House and Senate leaders from both parties as well as the four top lawmakers on the House and Senate intelligence committees. Additional meetings for the remaining members are tentatively set for Wednesday. Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the senior Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he will push Gabbard for more answers about the underlying complaint and why it took so long to get the report to lawmakers. The number of redactions make it hard to evaluate the allegations, he said. “The fact that this sat out there for six, seven, eight months now and we are only seeing it now, raises huge concerns in and of itself,” Warner said Sunday on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” The Republicans who lead the intelligence committees are backing Gabbard, making it less likely the panels take further steps to investigate the complaint. “It seemed like an effort by the president’s critics to undermine him,” Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, the Senate Intelligence Committee’s chairman, wrote Saturday on X. Gabbard noted in a lengthy social media post Saturday that Johnson was appointed interim inspector general for the intelligence community during President Joe Biden’s administration. She included a detailed timeline that she said shows she acted quickly to ensure the complaint reached Congress. Gabbard wrote that she was aware of the complaint in June and believed the investigation had ended after it was found non-credible, only for the inspector general’s office to inform her in December that the complaint had to be reviewed, redacted and sent to members of Congress. “I took immediate action to provide the security guidance to the Intelligence Community Inspector General who then shared the complaint and referenced intelligence with relevant members of Congress last week,” Gabbard wrote. She also accused Warner and the media of trying to use the complaint to smear her name. Copyright 2026 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.",center,2026-02-10T11:29:58.012391

Despite little to no daylight — plus months of frigid temperatures — people who live in northern Europe and above the Arctic Circle have learned how to cope mentally and physically with the annual onset of the winter blues, which can begin as early as October and last into April for some. The winter solstice will occur Dec. 21, marking the shortest day and longest night of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. While sunlight increases daily after that, winter won’t be over for a while yet. The Associated Press spoke to experts in Norway, Sweden and Finland about the winter blues. Here’s how they suggest looking for light, literally and figuratively, during the darkest months of the year: Dr. Timo Partonen, a research professor at the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare, said the dark winter affects our circadian rhythm. With limited daylight, our internal body clocks cannot reset or synchronize properly and it throws off our sleep. We may sleep longer in the winter, he said, but we don’t wake up refreshed and can remain tired the rest of the day. Partonen recommended trying a dawn simulator, sometimes known as a sunrise alarm clock, to gradually light up your bedroom and ease you awake. In addition to being more tired, we’re more likely to withdraw from others socially in the wintertime. We’re more irritable, Partonen said, and more prone to fights with friends. This article is part of AP’s Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health.  Be Well. It’s important to maintain our relationships, he said, because symptoms rarely improve in isolation. And since keeping up with exercise is also key to combating the winter blues, consider inviting a friend along for a workout. It could also help keep off the wintertime weight gain — typically 2 to 5 kilograms (4 to 11 pounds) a year, Partonen said — that’s fed by cravings for carbohydrates, especially in the evenings. Millions of people worldwide are estimated to suffer from seasonal depression. Also known as seasonal affective disorder, or SAD, patients typically have episodes of depression that begin in the fall and ease in the spring or summer. A milder form, subsyndromal SAD, is recognized by medical experts, and there’s also a summer variety of seasonal depression, though less is known about it. Scientists are learning how specialized cells in our eyes turn the blue wavelength part of the light spectrum into neural signals affecting mood and alertness. Sunlight is loaded with the blue light, so when the cells absorb it, our brains’ alertness centers are activated and we feel more awake and possibly even happier. Researcher Kathryn Roecklein at the University of Pittsburgh tested people with and without SAD to see how their eyes reacted to blue light. As a group, people with SAD were less sensitive to blue light than others, especially during winter months. That suggests a cause for wintertime depression. In severe cases, people need clinical support and antidepressant medications. Christian Benedict, a pharmacology professor at Uppsala University in Sweden, suggests light therapy for people with SAD as well as those who have a milder case of the winter blues. “It’s not like it’s a fate, an annual or a seasonal fate, and you cannot do anything about it,” Benedict said. “There are possibilities to affect it.” A routine of morning light therapy, using devices that emit light about 20 times brighter than regular indoor light, can be beneficial for both people with and without SAD. The light therapy helps to kickstart your circadian rhythm and increases serotonin in your brain, Benedict said. Research supports using a light that’s about 10,000 lux, a measure of brightness, for 30 minutes every morning. Special lights run from $70 to $400, though some products marketed for SAD are not bright enough to be useful. Your insurance company might cover at least part of the cost if you’ve been diagnosed with SAD. Partonen recommended using both a dawn simulator and a light therapy device each day before noon. Yale has tested products and offers a list of recommendations, and the nonprofit Center for Environmental Therapeutics has a consumer guide to selecting a light. And don’t forget to, well, look on the bright side. It’s crucial to embrace winter instead of dreading it, according to Ida Solhaug, an associate professor in psychology at the University of Tromsø, also known as the Arctic University of Norway — the world’s northernmost university. Prioritize a positive outlook as a survival strategy and learn to appreciate the change in seasons. It’s a typical Norwegian way of thinking, she said, that can make all the difference when there’s very little daylight for months. “It’s part of the culture,” she said. And don’t forget to take advantage of both outdoor and indoor hobbies, she said. Inside, channel hygge — the Danish obsession with getting cozy — and snuggle up on the couch with blankets and a movie. But don’t hibernate all winter. After the film finishes, head outside with a thermos for fika, the traditional Swedish coffee break. Even during cloudy days, a quick walk in the fresh air will help, she said. And if you’re brave enough, do a cold plunge like many people in the Nordics. Solhaug tries to jump into the frigid waters off the coast of Tromsø, an island 350 kilometers (217 miles) north of the Arctic Circle, at least once a week, adding that it makes her feel revitalized during the long winter. “Challenge yourself to look for light in the darkness,” she said. After all, as many Nordic people say, there’s no such thing as bad weather — only bad clothing. Finland’s President Alexander Stubb, too, had some tips for how to tackle Nordic winters. When asked in an interview with The Associated Press last month how to survive the cold season, he had some very specific advice. “Take an ice bath and then followed up by a sauna and do one more ice bath, one more sauna, then a shower and go out there. You’ll manage,” Stubb said. __ Dazio reported from Berlin. Copyright 2026 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.",center,2026-02-10T11:29:59.782558

All Rights Reserved. Copyright 2026 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Cleveland Browns quarterback Deshaun Watson looks on during a preseason NFL football game against the Carolina Panthers, Aug. 8, 2025, in Charlotte, N.C. (AP Photo/Jacob Kupferman, File) HOUSTON (AP) — The final two of nearly 30 civil lawsuits that Cleveland Browns quarterback Deshaun Watson had faced from women accusing him of sexual misconduct have been dismissed, according to court records. The dismissal of these two lawsuits clears Watson of legal problems he had been facing since 2021 after 27 women came forward and accused him in court filings in Texas of exposing himself, touching them with his genitals or kissing them against their will, mostly during massage appointments. Some of the women alleged Watson, 30, forced them to perform oral sex and one woman accused him of sexually assaulting her. The dismissals come as both lawsuits had been set to go to trial in the next few weeks. The accusations against Watson were made when he played for the Houston Texans. It is believed that Watson has no other lawsuits pending in connection with the sexual misconduct allegations. One of the lawsuits that was dismissed on Friday has been settled, said Tony Buzbee, the attorney for the woman who had filed it. Buzbee declined to comment further, citing confidentiality of the settlement agreement. Buzbee’s client alleged Watson touched her with his penis multiple times during a massage session. It was not immediately known if the other dismissed lawsuit had also been settled. Anissah Nguyen, an attorney for the woman who filed the lawsuit, didn’t immediately respond to an email or call seeking comment. Nguyen’s client had accused Watson of pressuring her to perform oral sex during a massage. Watson’s attorneys declined to comment. Watson, who was traded to the Browns in March 2022, has long denied any wrongdoing, and two separate Texas grand juries declined to indict him. One of his attorneys, Rusty Hardin, had previously said the allegations against Watson were “meritless.” “I don’t remember or recall any sexual encounters with her,” Watson said in a 2023 deposition he gave while being questioned about the woman represented by Nguyen. The woman represented by Nguyen had also sued the Houston Texans, alleging Watson had assaulted women with the help and resources of the team. The lawsuit against the Texans was also dismissed last week. A spokesperson for the Texans didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment. In July 2022, 30 women who had accused the Texans of turning a blind eye to allegations against their former star quarterback settled their legal claims against the team. It was not unusual that all the cases against Watson were settled, said David Ring, a California-based attorney who is not connected to the lawsuits and who has represented victims of sexual assault. He said the majority of civil lawsuits are typically resolved before going to trial and that high-profile defendants typically don’t want cases to play out in a public courtroom. “He’s trying to put all of this behind him,” Ring said. Watson’s legal problems began after dozens of women claimed to have been the victims of sexual misconduct or assault between 2017 and 2020. Most of the lawsuits against Watson were settled in 2022. Following the allegations, Watson was suspended for the first 11 games in 2022 for violating the league’s personal conduct policy. Watson was also fined $5 million and underwent a mandatory evaluation before being reinstated by the league. He has played in only 19 games for the Browns due to the NFL suspension and injuries. ___ Follow Juan A. Lozano: https://x.com/juanlozano70 Copyright 2026 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved. Copyright 2026 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. U.S. Chief of Naval Operations, Adm. Daryl Caudle, talks to selected journalists during his visit in Tokyo, Nov. 17, 2025. (AP Photo/Mari Yamaguchi, File) WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Navy’s top uniformed officer wants to convince commanders to use smaller, newer ships and other assets for missions instead of consistently turning to huge aircraft carriers — as seen now in the American military buildups off Venezuela and Iran. Adm. Daryl Caudle’s vision — what he calls his “Fighting Instructions” — calls for the Navy to deploy more tailored groups of ships and equipment that would offer the sea service more flexibility to respond to crises as they develop. Caudle spoke to The Associated Press before the rollout of the new strategy, which comes as the Trump administration has moved aircraft carriers and other ships to regions around the world to address emerging concerns. This has disrupted standing deployment plans, scrambled ships to sail thousands of miles and put increasing strain on vessels and equipment that are already facing mounting maintenance issues. The world’s largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, was redirected late last year from the Mediterranean Sea to the Caribbean Sea, where the crew ultimately supported last month’s operation to capture then-Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. And two weeks ago, the USS Abraham Lincoln arrived in the Middle East as tensions with Iran rise, having been pulled from the South China Sea. In an interview, Caudle said his strategy would make the Navy’s presence in regions like the Caribbean much leaner and better tailored to meet actual threats. He said he’s already spoken with the commander of U.S. Southern Command, which encompasses the Caribbean and Venezuela, “and we’re in negotiation on what his problem set is — I want to be able to convey that I can meet that with a tailored package there.” Speaking broadly, Caudle said he envisions the mission in the Caribbean focusing more on interdictions and keeping an eye on merchant shipping. The U.S. military has already seized multiple suspicious and falsely flagged tankers connected with Venezuela that were part of a global shadow fleet of merchant vessels that help governments evade sanctions. “That doesn’t really require a carrier strike group to do that,” Caudle said, adding that he believes the mission could be done with some smaller littoral combat ships, Navy helicopters and close coordination with the Coast Guard. The Navy has had 11 ships, including the Ford and several amphibious assault ships with thousands of Marines, in South American waters for months. It is a major shift for a region that has historically seen deployments of one or two smaller Navy ships. “I don’t want a lot of destroyers there driving around just to actually operate the radar to get awareness on motor vessels and other tankers coming out of port,” Caudle said. “It’s really not a well-suited match for that mission.” To compensate, Caudle envisions leaning more heavily on drones or other robotic systems to offer military commanders the same capabilities but with less investment from Navy ships. He acknowledges this will not be an easy sell. Caudle said even if a commander knows about a new capability, the staff “may not know how to ask for that, integrate it, and know how to employ it in an effective way to bring this new niche capability to bear.” “That requires a bit of an education campaign here,” he later added. President Donald Trump has favored large and bold responses from the Navy and has leaned heavily toward displays of firepower. Trump has referred to aircraft carriers and their accompanying destroyers as armadas and flotillas. He also revived the historic battleship title for a planned type of ship that would sport hypersonic missiles, nuclear cruise missiles, rail guns and high-powered lasers. If built, the proposed “Trump-class battleship” would be longer and larger than the World War II-era Iowa-class battleships, though the Navy has not only struggled to field some of the technologies that Trump says will be aboard but it has had challenges building even smaller, less sophisticated ships on time and on budget. Given this trend, Caudle said if the Lincoln’s recent redeployment to the Middle East were to happen under his new plan, he would talk with the Indo-Pacific commander about how to compensate for the loss. “So, as Abraham Lincoln comes out, I’ve got a three ship (group) that’s going to compensate for that,” Caudle suggested as an example. Caudle argues that his vision already is in place and working in Europe and North America “for the last four or five years.” He said this could apply soon in the Bering Strait, which separates Russia and Alaska, noting that “the importance of the Arctic continues to get more and more prevalent” as China, Russia and the U.S. prioritize the region. Trump has cited the threat from China and Russia in his demands to take over Greenland, the Arctic island overseen by NATO ally Denmark. Caudle said he knows he needs to offer the commanders in that region “more solutions” and his “tailored force packages would be a way to get after that.” Copyright 2026 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved. Copyright 2026 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. A security officer works inside of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) building headquarters, Feb. 10, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File) NEW YORK (AP) — One year after the Trump administration took control of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the consumer watchdog has largely retreated from enforcement and regulatory work, changes that consumer advocates and Democrats now estimate have cost Americans at least $19 billion in financial relief. In a report provided to The Associated Press ahead of its release by the office of Sen. Elizabeth Warren on Monday, the authors say the CFPB harmed consumers by abandoning major consumer protections, stalling investigation and dismissing a number of lawsuits. “Trump’s attempt to sideline the CFPB has cost families billions of dollars over the last year alone,” said Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, as well as one of the bureau’s fiercest defenders in Congress. The administration and congressional Republicans have argued that the bureau needed to be downsized and reined in because it had grown too large and overreaching. The administration assumed control of the CFPB in February 2025 after Rohit Chopra, the bureau’s director under President Joe Biden, resigned, leaving White House budget director Russell Vought as acting director. Since then, few new investigations have been opened, many employees have been ordered not to work and several pending enforcement actions against financial companies have been dropped. The White House announced in April that it wanted to reduce the Bureau’s staff from 1,689 positions to 207 positions, but that move has been blocked by courts. Even if the employees’ union does succeed in its lawsuit against Vought, Congress cut the bureau’s budget by roughly half in Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. It’s unlikely that all of those employees will still have their jobs once all litigation is settled. “The CFPB may still be standing, but it’s essentially on life support,” said Chuck Bell, advocacy program director at Consumer Reports, in a statement. Consumer Reports put out its own data Monday that arrives at similar conclusions as Warren’s office. A spokeswoman for the CFPB did not respond to a request for comment. One form of relief the report said consumers were denied was a limit on overdraft fees, which the Biden CFPB finalized in 2024 but the Republican-led Congress overturned last year. That would have saved consumers $5 billion a year, according to the Bureau’s estimates at the time. The bureau also tried to cap the amount of money consumers pay to credit card companies when they pay their bills late. That would have saved Americans roughly $10 billion, according to Bureau estimates when the rule was proposed. The regulation was blocked by a federal court last year, and the bureau, under the control of the Trump administration, decided not to fight the lawsuit in court. Another roughly $4 billion in consumer relief would have come from a series of lawsuits or settlements that were dismissed by the bureau under Acting Director Vought. For example, the bureau sued Capital One in January 2025 for $2 billion, days before President Trump was to be sworn into office, alleging that Capital One has misrepresented the interest rate paid on its savings accounts to customers. That lawsuit was dismissed. The bureau also sued Early Warning Systems, the company that runs the money transfer service Zelle, in December 2024 for $870 million alleging that the EWS and the banks that operate Zelle were negligent in protecting consumers from fraud and scams. That lawsuit was also dismissed last year. There’s also been a slowdown in the number of complaints resolved by the bureau as well. The CFPB runs its own consumer complaint database, where a consumer can allege wrongdoing by their bank or financial services company and the bureau will act as intermediary between the consumer and financial company to resolve the complaint. Under the Biden CFPB, roughly half of all consumer complaints were resolved with relief for the consumer, whereas under the Trump CFPB, that figure has dwindled to less than 5%. The independent Government Accountability Office made public a separate report Monday outlining its attempts to keep track of the Trump administration’s reorganization and restructuring of the CFPB. The GAO said it received no cooperation from the White House or the bureau, and the GAO needed to rely on mostly public records to produce its report. In a response to the GAO, the CFPB cited ongoing litigation between its employees and management as the primary reason why it could not cooperate. The GAO’s report largely matches what has been documented in news reports that the bureau has cancelled dozens of enforcement actions against alleged wrongdoers, unwound rules and regulations that previous bureau management said would protect consumers or bring them financial relief. There have been even rules and regulations enacted during President Trump’s first term that have been targeted by the bureau’s current management. Mark Paoletta, the bureau’s chief legal officer and effectively its deputy director under Vought, called the GAO’s report “biased and flawed” in a letter to the agency did not raise any specific issues with its conclusions, other than to say the GAO was working with incomplete information.

(Samantha Martin/Hanover County Protection via AP) ASHLAND, Va. (AP) — The masked burglar broke into the closed Virginia liquor store early on Saturday and hit the bottom shelf, where the scotch and whisky were stored. The bandit was something of a nocturnal menace: bottles were smashed, a ceiling tile collapsed and alcohol pooled on the floor. The suspect acted like an animal because, in fact, he’s a raccoon. On Saturday morning, an employee at the Ashland, Virginia-area liquor store found the trash panda passed out on the bathroom floor at the end of his drunken escapade. “I personally like raccoons,” said Samantha Martin, an officer who works at the local animal control. “They are funny little critters. He fell through one of the ceiling tiles and went on a full-blown rampage, drinking everything.” Martin said she took the raccoon back to the animal shelter, though she had her fair share of giggles along the way. “Another day in the life of an animal control officer, I guess,” she said. The Hanover County Animal Protection and Shelter commended Martin for handling the break-in, and confirmed the raccoon had sobered up. “After a few hours of sleep and zero signs of injury (other than maybe a hangover and poor life choices), he was safely released back to the wild, hopefully having learned that breaking and entering is not the answer,” the agency said.

In this June 17, 2009, file photo, shoppers are reflected in the window as they walk past an Eddie Bauer store, in Seattle. (AP Photo/Elaine Thompson, File) NEW YORK (AP) — The operator of roughly 180 Eddie Bauer stores across the U.S. and Canada has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, blaming declining sales and a litany of other industry headwinds. The bankruptcy filing marks the third time in a little over two decades for the storied-but-now-tired brand that began as a Seattle fishing shop, later outfitted the first American to climb Mount Everest and made thousands of newfangled down jackets and sleeping bags for the military during World War II. Eddie Bauer LLC said Monday it had entered into a restructuring pact with its secured lenders as it made the filing in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey. Most Eddie Bauer retail and outlet stores in the U.S. and Canada will remain open as the company winds down certain locations. It noted that it will conduct a court-supervised sales process, and if a sale can’t be executed, it will begin a wind-down of its U.S. and Canadian operations. AP’s Lisa Dwyer reports on another bankruptcy filing for an iconic outdoor retailer. “This is not an easy decision,” said Marc Rosen, CEO of Catalyst Brands, which maintains the license to operate Eddie Bauer stores in the U.S. and Canada. “However, this restructuring is the best way to optimize value for the retail company’s stakeholders and also ensure Catalyst Brands remains profitable and with strong liquidity and cash flow.” Eddie Bauer’s stores outside of the U.S. and Canada are operated by other licensees, are not included in the Chapter 11 filings, and will stay open, according to the release. Authentic Brands Group continues to own the intellectual property associated with the Eddie Bauer brand and may license the brand to other operators, the company said. The operations of other brands in the Catalyst Brands portfolio are not affected by this filing and will continue in the normal course, according to the company. Eddie Bauer’s e-commerce and wholesale operations will also not be impacted by the wind down, as they are operated by a company called Outdoor 5, LLC. That was a transition it made in January and became effective Feb. 2. Eddie Bauer joins a growing list of U.S. retailers this year that are closing stores, as companies reorganize under bankruptcy protection or pare down their operations to focus on the most profitable businesses. The parent company of Saks Fifth Avenue said last month that it was seeking bankruptcy protection, buffeted by rising competition and the massive debt it took on to buy its rival in the luxury sector, Neiman Marcus, just over a year ago. A few days later, the parent company said it was closing most of its Saks Off 5th stores. Amazon said earlier this month that it was closing almost all of its Amazon Go and Amazon Fresh locations within days as it narrows its focus on food delivery and its grocery chain, Whole Foods Market. Eddie Bauer’s namesake founder — an avid outdoorsman — started the company in Seattle in 1920 as Bauer’s Sports Shop, according to the brand’s website. In 1945, after making more than 50,000 jackets for the military, it launched a mail-order catalog. “Bauer’s Sports Shop was not just a place where people purchased clothing and gear, it was a community hub where folks gathered to share their wisdom, learn, and talk about their experiences in the outdoors,” the website says. The company created an American goose-down insulated jacket, known as the “Skyliner,” in 1936, and it became the company’s first patented jacket. It also outfitted the first American to climb Mount Everest — James W. Whittaker — with an Eddie Bauer parka in 1963. After Bauer retired in 1968 and sold the business to his partner, the outdoor brand shifted more toward casual apparel and was bought by General Mills Inc. in 1971 and then by Spiegel Inc. in 1988. After Spiegel filed for bankruptcy in 2003 and most of its assets were sold, the remainder of the company was reorganized in 2005 as Eddie Bauer Holdings Inc. In June 2009, Eddie Bauer filed bankruptcy and was acquired by Golden State Capital, the following month. In 2021, it was acquired by Authentic Brands and SPARC Group LLC. A year ago, Catalyst was formed by the merger of SPARC and JCPenney, which Simon Property Group and fellow mall landlord Brookfield bought out of bankruptcy. Rosen noted that even prior to the inception of Catalyst Brands last year, Eddie Bauer was in a “challenged situation.” “Over the past year, these challenges have been exacerbated by various headwinds, including increased costs of doing business due to inflation, ongoing tariff uncertainty, and other factors,” he said. He noted that while Catalyst’s leadership was able to make improvements in product development and marketing, those changes could not be implemented fast enough to fully address the problems created over several years. Eddie Bauer had nearly 600 stores at its peak in 2001, according to CoStar Group Inc., a commercial real estate data firm. In a note published earlier this month, Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, wrote that while the Eddie Bauer name is “well known”, the brand hasn’t kept pace with rivals like Swedish outdoor brand Fjallraven and Canadian label Arc’teryx. He also cited issues with quality deteriorating, which, for an outdoor brand measured by the performance of its products, is very problematic. “And for many younger shoppers, the brand is seen as somewhat old-fashioned and a bit irrelevant, ” he noted. _____ AP Business Writer Mae Anderson contributed to this report. _____ This story has been corrected to show that Eddie Bauer outfitted the military during World War II, not World War I.

(Santiago Mejia/San Francisco Chronicle via AP) New York (AP) — To better understand some of the significance of Bad Bunny’s historic Super Bowl halftime performance on Sunday night, start at the end. “God Bless America,” were the first and few English-language words uttered by the Spanish-language performer, who then proceeded to list countries in the Americas, including the United States and Canada. Behind him, a screen read: “The only thing more powerful than hate is love,” a direct reference to his speech at the 2026 Grammy Awards where the Puerto Rican superstar took home the top prize. America, he seemed to be reminding his global audience including viewers in the U.S., makes up a number of countries in the Western Hemisphere. It was a poignant gesture for an artist whose performance was politicized the moment it was announced, labeled un-American by his detractors despite the fact that Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens. Most recently President Donald Trump described his set as “an affront to the Greatness of America.” In the final moments of his performance, Bad Bunny was joined by a crowd waving flags of different countries in the Americas, but also “territories of other countries like Bonaire or the U.S. Virgin Islands, ” said Petra Rivera-Rideau, associate professor of American studies at Wellesley College and co-author of “P FKN R: How Bad Bunny Became the Global Voice of Puerto Rican Resistance.” He was also surrounded by plena musicians — a Puerto Rican genre associated with community and protest — and held a football that read, “Together, we are America.” “This is a really profound statement of Latino belonging in the United States and immigrant belonging in the United States,” Rivera-Rideau said. “Bad Bunny is obviously very aware of the backlash against this halftime show. And a lot of that backlash has to do with this assumption that because it’s in Spanish, it’s somehow excluding people. And I think what we saw last night with Bad Bunny’s halftime show is that he was actually including people, inviting people into his world and at the same time, making a case that immigrants and Latinos are as much a fabric of the United States as anything else.” Simultaneously, he made the argument for “America” as a larger, hemispheric identity. “He is trying to reframe America as this continent-spanning container,” said Reanna Cruz, music critic and senior producer for Vox Media’s music podcast Switched on Pop. “The main takeaway I have from the performance is the highlight of community. … If we have nothing else in times of hardship, we have community and we have joy, and a way to access that is to not shut out your fellow humans in whatever country it may be. The reframing of America as something that spans half the globe is really radical.” There’s a long history of that idea. “Everyone from Rubén Lárez to Los Tigres del Norte have created songs that have used this idea of all of the Americas coming together … of America being a kind of a cohesive unit,” said Rivera-Rideau. “But I think what it really boils down to is a statement that Latinos, Latin Americans, Caribbean people, immigrants, they belong and they’re just as American as anybody else.” “He’s presenting a very capacious definition of what it is to be American,” said Christopher Campo-Bowen, assistant professor of musicology at Virginia Tech. “And within that, the idea of Puerto Rican sovereignty. “He is presenting everything that he finds that makes Puerto Rico unique. And what makes Puerto Rico an autonomy culture and actor in the hemisphere — and presenting it all at once — and then also broadcasting this unifying message of ‘We are all Americans,’” he added. “He’s encouraging us all to recognize that uniqueness but not to let that difference become a source of enmity or hatred.” Puerto Ricans are Americans in both ways Bad Bunny’s show explored — they are U.S. citizens, and the island nation is situated in the Americas. But it is complicated: Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens no matter where they are born and have been since 1917. But Puerto Ricans who live on the island have limited citizenship rights; they cannot vote for President, they have no representation in Congress and they can be drafted into the military. “What it boils down to is that Puerto Rico is a territory,” said Rivera-Rideau, an idea she says Bad Bunny explored when he waved the Puerto Rican flag with a light blue triangle, a color repeated on Lady Gaga’s dress. “That’s considered the original Puerto Rican flag. And once the U.S. takes over Puerto Rico in 1898, they change the color blue to match the U.S. flag. And so that light blue color on the Puerto Rican flag has become affiliated with Puerto Rican independence,” she explained. “So, I think we saw him commenting on this colonial relationship at the same time that he’s insisting on full recognition in the United States as a Latino, as an American, in the continental sense. Both things are happening in that halftime show.” That is also reflected in the music of Puerto Rico, and of course, Bad Bunny. Think of the genre salsa as an example, which “represents the kind of unique status of Puerto Rico vis-a-vis the mainland United States, in that salsa would not have been possible without this relationship,” said Campo-Bowen. He noted that in the late 1940s and early ‘50s, Puerto Ricans migrated to New York in large numbers because of massive changes on the island. “They start communities there, encounter other people from Latin America, and then salsa comes about out of that mixture. “It is based in the long history of colonialism and that carries those issues with it. But despite that, Puerto Rico has developed this unique culture with these unique musical signifiers which Bad Bunny is more than happy to draw on and celebrate.” Bad Bunny’s “God Bless America” contrasts certain conservative messaging of American identity. Consider the fact that there was an alternative halftime performance, organized by Turning Point USA and headlined by Kid Rock, called the “all-American Halftime show.” “Bad Bunny turns this upside down and he says, ‘No, ‘God bless America’ and ‘America’ is all of these Latin American and Caribbean nations and the U.S. and Canada. We’re all a part of it,” said Vanessa Díaz, associate professor of Chicano and Latino studies at Loyola Marymount University and co-author of “P FKN R.” “It was about unity, but it was also about staking Latinos’ claim in this country,” she said, particularly in a charged political moment as Trump’s immigration policies and executive actions have vastly expanded who is eligible for deportation, routine hearings have turned into deportation traps for migrants, detentions are prolonged and opposition for the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown grows. In her view, Bad Bunny’s performance was “profoundly political” — just as it was when he said “ICE Out” at the 2026 Grammys — but on this stage, for its message of joy and unity. “It was wildly imaginative and extremely educational. And yet we had fun and we danced and we cried,” Díaz said of the performance. “It was Bad Bunny at his best, being super specific about his homeland and its history and also welcoming people in to let themselves see themselves reflected in Puerto Rican culture and history.” “Joy is resistance and dancing is resistance,” Cruz said. “For people in the Latino community, the show is very clear in how political it is.” Copyright 2026 The Associated Press.

Eric Schmitt, R-Mo., joins 'The Sunday Briefing' to discuss fallout from the Arctic Frost probe and how he plans to move forward with future investigations, possible impeachments and more. Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., filed a formal complaint against Verizon on Monday after the carrier handed over his phone data to the Biden-era Department of Justice during its probe of President Donald Trump and the 2020 election – a move Republicans say violated the Constitution. Lawyers for Hagerty wrote in the complaint to the Federal Communications Commission, reviewed by Fox News Digital, that Verizon should publicly admit wrongdoing and discipline employees who were involved in complying with a subpoena for his phone data. Otherwise, the FCC should declare that Verizon violated federal law and assign an independent monitor to watch over the company, Hagerty’s lawyers wrote. ""Such discipline by the FCC would send a clear message that companies cannot collude with politically motivated prosecutors to violate customers’ rights,"" Hagerty’s lawyers wrote. ""Verizon is not above the law."" JACK SMITH FACES PUBLIC GRILLING ON CAPITOL HILL ABOUT TRUMP PROSECUTIONS Sen. Bill Hagerty exits the Capitol after voting, in Washington, D.C., on Friday, Oct. 3, 2025. (Graeme Sloan/Bloomberg via Getty Images) The Tennessee Republican's complaint detailed how Verizon complied with former special counsel Jack Smith’s team by giving the prosecutors a narrow set of Hagerty’s and several other GOP senators’ phone data as part of Smith’s investigation into President Donald Trump and the 2020 election. Verizon justified its actions in a letter to the Senate in the fall, saying the subpoenas appeared ""facially valid"" and only contained phone numbers. They did not identify the subscribers or include information about Smith's investigation, Verizon said. The phone company said it did not notify the senators about the subpoenas because they were accompanied by court-authorized gag orders. Fox News Digital reached out to a Verizon spokesperson for comment on the FCC complaint. Former special counsel Jack Smith testifies during a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee in the Rayburn House Office Building on Capitol Hill on Jan. 22, 2026, in Washington, D.C. (Al Drago/Getty Images) Republicans have widely condemned the subpoenas, saying they violated the Constitution’s speech or debate clause, which gives Congress members an added layer of protection when it comes to prosecutorial matters. Smith has repeatedly stood by them, saying he handled them according to DOJ policy at the time. The policy in question has since been changed to require prosecutors to notify the courts if requested gag orders pertain to Congress members. Previously, it did not include that requirement, leading the courts to authorize gag orders against the senators and deprive them of the ability to try to quash the subpoenas.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by LSEG. Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate in Alabama and former Trump White House official Morgan Murphy discusses President Donald Trump’s pressure on Russia as war on Ukraine continues. President Donald Trump vowed to impose ""very severe consequences"" on Russia in 2025 if it didn't commit to a deal to end its war on Ukraine. As the war nears its four-year anniversary in late February, national security experts tell Fox News Digital that Russia is facing tangible consequences for the war. Those are through its network of proxy countries that have directly endured the might of the U.S. military and subsequently left Russia with fewer streams of revenue and resources, they say. ""The president's moves as it pertains to Russia are really strategic,"" Morgan Murphy, who previously served as the senior public diplomacy advisor to the president’s special envoy to Ukraine in 2025, told Fox News Digital. ""So if you look at what he's done with Iran and with Venezuela, these are two Russian proxies, right? Iran is a close ally of Russia."" ""They sell a lot of drones to Russia,"" Murphy, who is running as a GOP Senate candidate to represent Alabama, continued. ""Venezuela was again a proxy of Russia here in our hemisphere, and Trump is in the process of taking Iran off the table. He's certainly taken Venezuela off the chessboard, and that that has to change Putin's calculus, because he sees in President Trump a president who follows what he says he's going to do."" ZELENSKYY ANNOUNCES NEXT ROUND OF TALKS WITH US, RUSSIA AS UKRAINE AIMS FOR 'REAL AND DIGNIFIED END TO THE WAR President Donald Trump, right, greets Russian President Vladimir Putin as he arrives at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson Aug. 15, 2025, in Anchorage, Alaska. (Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) Russia's war on Ukraine has persisted since Feb. 24, 2022, about a year after Trump's first administration ended and during President Joe Biden's presidency. Trump campaigned on ending the war upon his second inauguration in 2025, but ending the war has proven more difficult than anticipated as the U.S. continues negotiations. A White House official who spoke to Fox Digital said Trump is driven by humanitarian concerns and wants the conflict ended to stop the needless loss of life. The official added that in recent months his team has made major headway toward a settlement, pointing to Trump’s own remarks that ""very good things"" are developing between Ukraine and Russia. According to the official, recent negotiations in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, were substantive and constructive, with U.S., Ukrainian and Russian delegations agreeing to a 314-person prisoner exchange — the first in five months. While more work is ahead, the official argued that breakthroughs like this show sustained diplomacy is producing real, measurable progress toward ending the war. Trump launched a series of strikes on Iran in June 2025 that hobbled the country's covert nuclear program. Massive protests swept Iran in December 2025 as citizens spoke out against the government and its cratering economy. Iran violently cracked down on the nationwide protests, with thousands of citizens reportedly killed and the Trump administration warning Iran that it would face U.S. military action if the executions and killings continued. The U.S. and Iran held discussions in Oman Friday as Tehran, Iran, continues to obscure its nuclear ambitions, with military intervention on the table as the U.S. seeks to prevent Iran from having nuclear weapons capabilities. Iran and Russia have grown into a tighter wartime partnership in recent years, with U.S. and allied officials citing Iran’s supply of armed drones and other defense cooperation that has helped power Russia’s attacks in Ukraine — drawing the two heavily sanctioned regimes closer economically and militarily. Ret. Air Force Gen. Bruce Carlson pointed to the Trump administration's actions on Iran and Venezuela as evidence of how Trump is strategically pressuring Russia via its proxies to end the war in Ukraine. ""In any campaign, you don’t just target command centers — you cut supply lines and logistics,"" Carlson said. ""Pressuring Russian proxies does exactly that. Venezuela, Iran, and the shadow fleet are key arteries feeding Russia’s war in Ukraine. Additionally, by pressing Europe to increase NATO spending and move off Russian oil and gas, we are directly altering Moscow’s decision-making."" WITKOFF SAYS TALKS WITH RUSSIAN ENVOY WERE 'PRODUCTIVE AND CONSTRUCTIVE' AMID TRUMP ADMIN'S PEACE PUSH Carlson argued that, strategically, the trend lines are moving against Moscow as the U.S. ramps up pressure on Russia’s partners — leaving Putin with fewer backers, tighter resources and less flexibility, and undermining any assumption that dragging out the war comes without a cost. Iran and Russia have grown into a tighter wartime partnership in recent years. (Maxim Shemetov/Reuters) The retired Air Force general added that Putin and his proxies operate as a single ecosystem: Russia’s campaign relies on outside suppliers and sanctions-busting networks, so hitting any link in that chain can weaken Russia’s revenue and its ability to sustain attacks on Ukrainian civilians. ""But ensuring a lasting and fair peace is not solely about pressuring Russia. As the cold winter continues in Ukraine, there are increasing concerns on Ukraine’s energy needs and air defense systems. U.S. and European support remain vital,"" he added. UKRAINE RACES TO BOLSTER AIR DEFENSES AS PUTIN’S STRIKE PAUSE NEARS END Map of U.S. strikes on Iran. (Fox News) As tensions with Iran heighten, the Trump administration successfully captured Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro on sweeping narco-trafficking charges in January. Venezuela is another Russian ally, publicly backing Moscow and maintaining high-level diplomatic ties, while giving Russia a Western Hemisphere foothold through military-technical cooperation and deep dependence on Russian arms — a relationship that has triggered U.S. sanctions actions tied to Venezuela’s oil sector and Russian-linked firms. ""The removal of Maduro stripped Moscow of a key client in our hemisphere, and the increased pressure on Iran threatens the weapons and drone supply chain that Russia uses against Ukrainian civilians,"" Carrie Filipetti, executive director of foreign policy group the Vandenberg Coalition, told Fox News Digital. ""This is how we have to change Putin’s long-term calculus.""

(XNY/Star Max/GC Images via Getty Images) ""For the first time, the United States has used the power of American diplomacy to bring Ukraine and Russia into trilateral diplomatic talks,"" Filipetti added. ""Combined with the threat of additional sanctions reliance and increased pressure on the countries that buy Russian energy, these steps are critical to shaking Russia’s assumption that time is on its side."" Ret. Air Force Lt. Gen. Richard Newton told Fox News Digital that when Trump warned Russia of severe consequences in 2025 if Moscow did not end the war, the threat was followed by tangible consequences that reverberated through the Kremlin. ""Deterrence and leverage requires our adversaries (to) believe we will act,"" Newton said. ""President Trump is doing just that by disrupting the systems that fund and sustain Putin’s war. The capture of Maduro and the just announced trade deal with India's Prime Minister Modi — that forces India off of Russian oil — is a major blow to Russia’s war machine."" The White House said in February that it struck with India to increase U.S. energy imports and stop buying Russian oil. The U.S. tops the world in daily oil production, with Saudi Arabia and Russia following behind. Filipetti argued that peace in Ukraine is only obtained by forcing Russia to face ""real consequences."" ""Vladimir Putin is responsible for a war of aggression marked by atrocities against Ukrainian civilians, and any lasting peace must impose real consequences on Russia itself. And weakening Russia’s proxies and isolating Putin is one of the most effective ways to reduce his ability to wage war,"" Filipetti said. ""When it comes to China, North Korea, and Iran — without question these authoritarians are facing a very different calculus than just a few months ago,"" she said. RUSSIA, UKRAINE TO DISCUSS TERRITORY AS TRUMP SAYS BOTH SIDES 'WANT TO MAKE A DEAL' While Newton pointed to a shadow-fleet sanctions package and another sanctions package that are moving through Congress, along with higher NATO spending and a tougher allied military posture, as key pressure points he says could help drive a peace deal. Republican South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham is promoting a sweeping Russia sanctions bill that would tighten the screws on Moscow by punishing countries and companies that keep buying Russian energy with secondary sanctions and tariffs, while a separate bipartisan ""shadow fleet"" package would target the tankers, insurers and shell networks Russia uses to move oil and evade sanctions. Murphy argued that Trump already has sketched what he sees as a realistic off-ramp for Moscow — one he says even some Democrats would recognize as the best deal Putin is likely to get — including restoring Russia’s seat at the top diplomatic table, reopening some Western commercial access, and acknowledging Russia’s current occupation of Ukrainian territory without formally recognizing sovereignty. ZELENSKYY HOLDING UP RUSSIA-UKRAINE PEACE PROCESS, TRUMP SAYS Murphy likened that offer to a ""golden bridge"" for Putin to exit the war, but said the Kremlin has so far declined it, making the next move ultimately Russia’s choice — and raising the question of how many more casualties Moscow is willing to absorb with no clear endpoint in sight. Members of the National Police Special Purpose Battalion of Zaporizhzhia region fire a Bohdana self-propelled howitzer toward Russian troops in Donetsk region, Ukraine Jan. 23, 2026. (Stringer/Reuters) The war underscores a Russian worldview U.S. negotiators often misread through a Western lens, Murphy said, explaining Russia is shaped by catastrophic losses in World War I and World War II and a deep-seated suspicion that invasion is a recurring threat. He said that unpredictability is why the U.S. military has long used the ""Crazy Ivan"" moniker for Russian behavior. Trump is meanwhile putting himself in the Russians’ shoes, Murphy argued, and meeting the moment with a clearer-eyed read of Moscow’s mindset and history. ""It is a decision that the Russians are going to have to make. How many more lives do they want to feed into this meat grinder? How many more deaths are they willing to endure?"" Murphy said.

Andrew Cherkasky, a former federal prosecutor, told Fox News Digital ""there is undoubtedly a lot of money behind"" agitators in Minneapolis, saying if alleged foreign money is involved there should be an investigation. FIRST ON FOX: A damning new report was released Tuesday morning ahead of a House Ways & Means Committee hearing aimed at exposing foreign actors sending money to U.S. nonprofits. The hearing, which is titled, ""Foreign Influence in American Non-profits: Unmasking Threats from Beijing and Beyond,"" will begin around 10:00 a.m. EST. Six foreign entities have funneled more than $2.65 billion into American politics, according to a new report by conservative watchdog Americans for Public Trust (APT), which highlights a loophole that APT says allows foreign nationals to funnel money to influence American politics ""virtually unchecked."" Foreign nationals are prohibited from donating directly to political campaigns, but money supporting U.S. candidates for office or their viewpoints can also come from 501(c)(3) and (c)(4) nonprofits. HOUSE REPUBLICANS SOUND ALARM OVER CCP-LINKED FAKE RESEARCH THREATENING US TAXPAYER-FUNDED SCIENCE Six foreign groups tied to wealthy individuals overseas have funneled over $2.6 billion to U.S.-based nonprofits, according to a new report released by conservative watchdog group Americans for Public Trust (APT). (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images) ""Foreign donors can currently fund U.S.-based advocacy groups – most often 501(c)(3)s and 501(c)(4)s – virtually unchecked,"" the report alleges. It adds that while the money APT uncovered is ""highly concerning"" solely on its own, there is ""undoubtedly even more overseas funding sources backing and influencing U.S. advocacy efforts."" The six entities highlighted in APT's report come from Switzerland, Denmark and the United Kingdom. The largest donor identified in the report was Switzerland-based Oak Foundation, established by British billionaire retail mogul Alan Parker, which has given around $753 million to U.S.-based advocacy groups. Through the Oak Foundation, Parker has supported left-wing environmental groups like Greenpeace, the Environmental Law Institute, the World Resources Institute and the World Wildlife Fund, according to the Capital Research Center's Influence Watch, which cited the group's grant database that now appears to be removed. Influence Watch added that through its grants, the Oak Foundation has positioned itself as a major supporter of China's Belt and Road Initiative, which China critics argue is part of a geopolitical strategy disguised as infrastructure investment. APT's report also points out that the Swiss-based Oak Foundation has poured tens of millions into the Arabella network of left-wing advocacy groups, including $67 million to the New Venture Fund, $12 million to the Windward Fund and $2.8 million to the Hopewell Fund. The left-wing Tides Foundation has also received money from the Oak Foundation. TAX COMMITTEE REPUBLICANS PRESS FOR TREASURY CRACKDOWN ON NONPROFITS PROMOTING FRAUD, 'ANTI-AMERICAN' HATE The left-wing Arabella network received funding from the Copenhagen-based KR Foundation and the Swiss-based Laudes Foundation as well, according to APT, which found these two groups have passed a combined $55.6 million to U.S. advocacy groups. The KR Foundation was founded by the descendants of Villum Kann Rasmussen, a Danish civil engineer and businessman who founded the VKR Group, while the Laudes Foundation was established by the Brenninkmeijer family, a German-Dutch business dynasty. Entities founded by Swiss billionaire Hansjörg Wyss came in second on APT's list of six foreign donor organizations. The Wyss Foundation and the Berger Action Fund have reportedly passed more than $673 million to U.S.-based advocacy groups.

(Photo by Craig Barritt/Getty Images for Oceana) ""The groups funded by Wyss utilize their immense resources to advance a progressive agenda, mold policy debates and decisions, and influence American elections. His foreign funding network focuses on policy priorities such as radical environmentalism, championing sweeping changes to election laws, and directly engaging in campaign activities, including voter mobilization efforts and political attack ads,"" APT's report states.

LAWMAKERS PROBE NATIONAL FFA OVER CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY TIES AND DEI PROGRAMS The remaining two foreign entities mentioned in APT's report, the U.K.-based Children's Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF) and the Quadrature Climate Foundation, have allegedly passed hundreds of millions of dollars to U.S.-based groups, respectively, similar to Parker's and Wyss' groups. CIFF has passed approximately $638.2 million to U.S. advocacy groups, while Quadrature Climate Foundation has passed over around $532.5 million, according to APT. CIFF, backed by British billionaire Christopher Hohn, has engaged in ""aggressive left-wing advocacy"" around climate change and social justice, including a group wanting to ban gas stoves, according to APT. Among the funding is also more than $10 million to two Arabella-managed nonprofits, according to the report.

It is the philanthropic arm of the London-based hedge fund Quadrature Capital, founded by billionaires Greg Skinner and Suneil Setiya. Quadrature Climate Foundation's largest recipient, according to APT, was ClimateWorks Foundation, which got $147 million from them. 25 million dollars of that money went ""to support the acceleration of electric vehicles,"" while another $6 million was reportedly earmarked for financial regulation efforts aimed at mitigating climate change risks. ""For years, foreign organizations and megadonors have quietly poured billions of dollars into the U.S. political sphere with little to no accountability,"" APT complained in its report.

The House Oversight Committee released the tape of Maxwell's deposition on X.(Credit: Oversight Committee) The House Oversight Committee's deposition of Ghislaine Maxwell ended less than an hour after it began on Monday morning, when the convicted accomplice of the late Jeffrey Epstein pleaded the Fifth Amendment. Maxwell appeared before lawmakers virtually for a closed-door interview in the House bipartisan probe into the federal government's handling of Epstein's case. Her attorney apparently told lawmakers, however, that she could not implicate neither President Donald Trump nor former President Bill Clinton in any wrongdoing. ""[B]oth President Trump and President Clinton are innocent of any wrongdoing. Ms. Maxwell alone can explain why, and the public is entitled to that explanation,"" lawyer David Oscar Markus posted on X after the deposition. NEW GHISLAINE MAXWELL MUGSHOT INCLUDED IN DOJ'S LATEST EPSTEIN FILES RELEASE Markus also told lawmakers that she would only answer questions if her prison sentence was cut short by Trump, according to the statement. ""If this Committee and the American public truly want to hear the unfiltered truth about what happened, there is a straightforward path. Ms. Maxwell is prepared to speak fully and honestly if granted clemency by President Trump. Only she can provide the complete account. Some may not like what they hear, but the truth matters,"" his statement said. Maxwell is currently serving out a 20-year sentence at a Texas prison. ""As expected, Ghislaine Maxwell took the fifth and refused to answer any questions. This is obviously very disappointing,"" House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., told reporters after the deposition. ""We had many questions to ask about the crime she and Epstein committed, as well as questions about potential co-conspirators. We sincerely want to get to the truth for the American people and justice for the survivors."" Comer said Maxwell's lawyer told the committee that she would only answer questions if she was granted clemency by President Donald Trump. Maxwell did say through her attorney, however, that neither Trump nor Democrats on the panel, who spoke after Comer, accused Maxwell of trying to lobby for a pardon and demanded that Trump publicly rule out the possibility. ""What we did get was another episode in her long-running campaign for clemency from President Trump, and President Trump could end that today,"" said Rep. James Walkinshaw, D-Va. ""He could rule out clemency for Ghislaine Maxwell, the monster. The question for all of us today is why hasn't he done that?"" DEMOCRATS SAY CLINTONS' AGREEMENT TO TESTIFY UNDERCUTS SUBPOENA PUSH, WON'T BRING NEW EPSTEIN ANSWERS Jeffrey Epstein photographed in New York City on Feb. 23, 2011. (David McGlynn) The former British socialite was found guilty in December 2021 of being an accomplice in Epstein's scheme to sexually traffic and exploit female minors. The DOJ said at the time of her sentencing that Maxwell ""enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways."" Comer announced lawmakers would hear from Maxwell late last month during a meeting on holding former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in contempt of Congress for refusing to appear for his Epstein probe. ""We’ve been trying to get her in for a deposition. Our lawyers have been saying that she’s going to plead the Fifth, but we have nailed down a date, Feb. 9, where Ghislaine Maxwell will be deposed by this committee,"" Comer said at the time. Contempt proceedings against the Clintons stalled, however, after they agreed via their attorneys to appear in person on Capitol Hill just days before the full House of Representatives was expected to vote on referring the pair to the Department of Justice (DOJ) for criminal charges.

He agreed to delay her previous planned deposition in August after her lawyer asked him to wait until after the Supreme Court decided whether it would hear her appeal. The Supreme Court turned down Maxwell's case in October. She and the Clintons' depositions are part of the House Oversight Committee's months-long probe into how the government handled Epstein's case. Comer told reporters on Monday that five more depositions would happen in the coming weeks including former Victoria's Secret CEO Les Wexner on Feb. 18, Hillary Clinton on Feb. 26, Bill Clinton on Feb. 27, Epstein accountant Richard Khan on March 11, and Epstein attorney Darren Indyke on March 19.

Fox News chief congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on the end of a partial government shutdown as the battle over DHS funding continues ahead of a new deadline on ‘Fox News @ Night.’ The Senate is scrambling to avoid a third government shutdown under President Donald Trump, and after negotiations seemingly appeared to hit a brick wall, lawmakers are cautiously optimistic that a deal could be made. Senate Republicans received Senate Democrats' ""partisan wishlist"" of demands over the weekend, sources familiar with negotiations told Fox News Digital. The White House sent over its own counter-proposal, but several lawmakers weren't clear what was in the package as of Monday night. Some, including Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., wouldn't say, but noted that congressional Democrats and the White House were ""trading papers,"" and signaled that the back and forth activity was a good sign of negotiations moving forward. But lawmakers aren't out of the woods yet, a reality that Thune warned of since Senate Democrats demanded a two-week funding extension for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Congress has until Friday to avert a shutdown and little time to actually move a short-term patch from one side of the building to the other. REPUBLICANS WARN DEMOCRATS' ICE REFORM PUSH IS COVER TO DEFUND BORDER ENFORCEMENT Split image shows Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, left, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, right. Senate Republicans and Democrats are, for now, at odds on how to prevent a partial shutdown that would only affect the DHS. (Nathan Posner/Anadolu via Getty Images) Republicans are mulling another short-term extension, known as a continuing resolution (CR), to avert a partial shutdown. Thune said whether Democrats would sign off depended on how well background negotiations were going, but hinted that so far, things were moving toward a solution. ""I think, based on what I'm familiar with about the discussion so far, I think there is, but we'll know more when the proposal comes back,"" Thune said. ""Let's have a chance to evaluate it."" Thune later said that he planned to tee up another CR on Tuesday, but noted that the length would ""have to be negotiated. But let's see what the next day brings, and we'll go from there."" Democrats’ prime objective is reining in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), following the fatal shootings of Alex Pretti and Renee Nicole Good. The proposal they submitted included items that are a bridge too far for Republicans, including requiring ICE agents to get judicial warrants, de-mask and have identification ready — some in the GOP warn doing so would lead to more agents being doxxed, or when a person’s private information is made public, like their address. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., warned that the ""clock is ticking"" for Republicans to respond. SHUTDOWN AVERTED FOR NOW, BUT SENATE WARNS DHS FIGHT COULD TRIGGER ANOTHER IN DAYS Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., talks to reporters following the weekly Senate Republican Caucus policy luncheon at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 14, 2025, in Washington, D.C. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) ""We have sent you our proposals, and they are exceedingly reasonable,"" Schumer said on the Senate floor. ""I hope our colleagues on the other side, many of whom, at least here in the Senate, recognize that things need to change, show they're ready to act in a meaningful way."" Prior to Democrats finally handing over the legislative version of their demands on Saturday, Republicans publicly questioned if they actually wanted to have serious negotiations. That changed over the weekend. A White House official told Fox News that ""President Trump has been consistent, he wants the government open and the Administration has been working with both parties to ensure the American people don’t have to endure another drawn-out, senseless, and hurtful shutdown."" Meanwhile, the scope and scale of a possible third closure would be limited to just the DHS, but would really only have an effect on FEMA, TSA, the Coast Guard and other priorities under the agency's umbrella. That's because ICE and immigration operations are flush with billions from Trump's ""big, beautiful bill."" ""To say that the security of Americans is not paramount, I think, would be a huge mistake for the Democrats, and I certainly hope that they'll continue to operate in good faith,"" Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., and the chair of the Homeland Security spending panel, said. ""Because you do realize, ICE and [Customs and Border Patrol] would continue to be funded,"" she continued. SCHUMER, JEFFRIES MEND RIFT, PRESENT UNITED FRONT ON DHS REFORMS AS DEADLINE NEARS Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., argued that Senate Democrats' list of demands was reasonable and wanted Republicans to get serious about negotiating. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call, Inc. via Getty Images) Things are also about to get complicated quickly in the upper chamber. Lawmakers are set to leave Washington, D.C., for a weeklong recess this Thursday, and many are headed overseas to the Munich Security Conference. That starts on the day of the deadline and lasts through the weekend. Thune warned that it was possible he would cancel the upcoming recess, especially if there was little progress toward avoiding a DHS shutdown. Still, Senate Democrats believe that the ball is in the GOP's court and are waiting for their counterparts to act.

""I mean, we did not ask for the moon,"" he continued. ""We asked for targeted but impactful changes in the way that ICE is terrorizing American cities. So obviously we're willing to negotiate.""

The 2009 ""endangerment finding"" identifies six greenhouse gases that the Obama administration said pose ""a threat to public health and welfare."" That harm finding was then used to justify sweeping climate regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), such as raising fuel economy standards and limiting power plant emissions, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin hailed the move as cutting through government red tape in an interview with the Journal. ""This amounts to the largest act of deregulation in the history of the United States,"" Zeldin said.

The rollback does not yet affect power plants or oil and gas facilities. ""More energy drives human flourishing,"" Interior Secretary Doug Burgum told the outlet. ""Energy abundance is the thing that we have to focus on, not regulating certain forms of energy out."" Trump is reportedly expected to hold an event at the White House on Wednesday with Zeldin and Energy Secretary Chris Wright. There they will announce a new initiative for the Department of War to purchase electricity from coal-powered plants.

(Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) Collins was one of the Senate Republicans who voted to convict after the House impeached President Donald Trump in 2021 — but that Senate vote occurred after Trump had already departed from office and ultimately fell short of the threshold necessary for conviction. Fox News Digital reached out to the White House for comment on Tuesday, but did not immediately receive a response. Collins, a moderate Republican lawmaker in the blue-leaning northern New England state, has served in the Senate since 1997.

It is an honor to serve you, and I'm excited to announce my run for re-election to the U.S. Senate in 2026,"" she noted in another post on X. Collins is the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee's top target as they try to win back the Senate. And the Maine Democratic Party argued in a statement that ""Susan Collins has spent the last 30 years betraying Maine, from stripping Mainers’ affordable health care, to casting the decisive vote to confirm Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade, to voting with Donald Trump 94% of the time."" ""She now faces some of the lowest approval ratings of her career because Mainers see through her political games and fake shows of concern. In November, we will reject her at the ballot box,"" added state party executive director Devon Murphy-Anderson. But Senate Majority Leader John Thune praised the senator as ""a proven leader who delivers results for Maine. I’ve worked closely with her and have seen firsthand her work ethic and effectiveness. We need Susan Collins in the U.S. Senate and in the fight to deliver results for Maine and America."" And National Republican Senatorial Committee chair Sen.

Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel discusses the ramifications of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons warning against trans surgeries for youth on 'America Reports.' FIRST ON FOX: Conservative lawfare group America First Legal (AFL) has been filing records requests after 15 Democrat-led states and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, D, sued to block President Trump's executive order banning sex changes for minors, in an attempt to find out whether the harm being alleged in their lawsuit is actually happening. Fox News Digital reported last month on how AFL's more than a dozen records requests to state departments of health were either ignored, or did not include any responsive records documenting the harms the Democratic states' lawsuit warns stem from the president's executive order. One of the states that AFL said ignored its records requests, Connecticut, did subsequently return to them with responsive records. However, according to AFL, the documents provided by Connecticut's health department continue to lend evidence that the harm being cited in Democrats' multi-state lawsuit is nonexistent. ""I don't see any impact to HSS funding or federal grants related to this executive order,"" said an email that was among what appeared to be three records that the Connecticut Department of Public Health provided to AFL, plus an additional final page that was entirely redacted.

(Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP Photo) The email came from Elizabeth Frugale, a Section Chief for Health Statistics and Surveillance at the Connecticut public health department, in response to a question from a grants management and budget supervisor, Aaron Knight, inquiring whether President Trump's executive order on transgender surgeries ""adversely impacts any of your Federal grants."" Frugale's response stands in contrast to claims in the lawsuit against the president's executive order on sex changes, which argued the directive had ""immediately"" jeopardized federal funding and disrupted public health systems. ""If Connecticut was not financially impacted by the Executive Order, it should have declined to join a lawsuit,"" said Dan Epstein, Vice President of America First Legal. ""To challenge, without cause, Executive Order 14187’s assurance that taxpayer dollars are not used for chemical and surgical mutilation of children, forces the courts to adjudicate political grievances, not actual disputes. AFL will continue to expose unfounded attempts to clog the federal courts as part of state lawfare against the Administration."" MAJOR CONNECTICUT HOSPITALS BEGIN 'WINDING DOWN' YOUTH GENDER PROGRAMS CITING 'EVOLVING LANDSCAPE' The third record given in response to AFL's records request was just an employee notice asking folks to review a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) halting Trump's executive directive on trans surgeries for minors. A nationwide preliminary injunction halting Trump's executive order on transgender surgeries was issued just a few months after it came down. Minneasotans hold a rally at the capitol on March 6, 2022, to support trans kids around the country. (Michael Siluk/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) When asked how plaintiff's could show proof of harm for a policy measure that has been halted by the courts, Epstein said the plaintiffs in the case still must show ""standing"" for a court to provide a remedy. He noted that just because the plaintiffs filed their suit early does not mean this responsibility disappears. ""Because standing is necessary for any federal court to provide a remedy, plaintiffs must plead concrete evidence of harm in their complaint,"" Epstein asserted. ""Here, plaintiffs' complaint failed to show an actual, traceable loss tied to the federal action, beyond merely speculative claims of harm or generalized concerns. Filing suit early does not eliminate this requirement to establish standing."" CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP AFL’s records requests to all the health departments belonging to states listed in the lawsuit, which was filed on Aug. 1, sought an array of records. Among them were documents showing the states had actually experienced the harms they claimed in their lawsuit, such as evidence of prosecutions or penalties for providers, clinic closures, reduced services and increased medical or mental-health crises for transgender adolescents. The group also asked for records showing higher costs for services like counseling, crisis intervention or hospitalizations, worsened mental and physical health outcomes or the states’ inability to meet legal obligations to provide medical care for minors in state custody. AFL asked for any internal communications specifically referencing the executive order and its alleged effects as well. Democrat-led states that are suing over alleged ""harm"" caused by one of President Trump's executive orders tied to transgender minors are being pressed for proof of their claims. (Getty Images) Only four states — Massachusetts, Illinois, Nevada and Connecticut — have provided any sort of response thus far. Furthermore, the responses that did arrive indicated there were no responsive records relating to AFL's requests, even though they asked for documents pertaining to precisely what the multi-state lawsuit against Trump's executive order alleges. Trump's Executive Order 14187 is also being challenged for alleged discrimination in a lawsuit against the Health and Human Services Department led by New York Attorney General Letitia James. Fox News Digital reached out with questions to the Connecticut Attorney General's Office and the state's public health department in response to AFL's allegations, but did not receive a response in time for publication.

The top two congressional Democrats have, for now, rejected President Donald Trump and Republicans’ offer to avert a shutdown as the deadline rapidly approaches. For several hours Monday night, both Republicans and Democrats were near-radio silent about the nature of the counter-offer from the White House. That was, in part, because some lawmakers had no idea what was in it. But the silence appeared to spell yet another positive step toward averting the shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

""The initial GOP response is both incomplete and insufficient in terms of addressing the concerns Americans have about [Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s] lawless conduct,"" they continued. ""Democrats await additional detail and text."" While not the death knell for negotiations to fund DHS or to agree to a short-term funding extension, it does slow some of the optimistic momentum that Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said was building over the weekend. REPUBLICANS WARN DEMOCRATS' ICE REFORM PUSH IS COVER TO DEFUND BORDER ENFORCEMENT President Donald Trump during an announcement in the South Court Auditorium of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building at the White House in Washington, D.C., on Thursday, Feb. 5, 2026. (Aaron Schwartz/CNP/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Democrats’ prime objective is reining in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), following the fatal shootings of Alex Pretti and Renee Nicole Good. They finally turned over their legislative proposals to rein in DHS and ICE to Republicans on Saturday. The proposal they submitted included items that are a bridge too far for Republicans, including requiring ICE agents to get judicial warrants, unmask and have identification ready — some in the GOP warn doing so would lead to more agents being doxxed, when a person’s private information is made public, like their address. The White House’s counter-offer was in response to Democrats’ list of demands and has been kept under heavy lock and key. SHUTDOWN AVERTED FOR NOW, BUT SENATE WARNS DHS FIGHT COULD TRIGGER ANOTHER IN DAYS Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., is readying a short-term funding extension for DHS, and hopes that Senate Democrats will support it. (Graeme Sloan/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Before Schumer and Jeffries’ rebellion, Republicans were already mulling turning to another short-term funding extension, known as a continuing resolution (CR), for DHS. That’s because after the House passed the Trump-Schumer funding deal last week, lawmakers had only eight days to figure out how to fund the trickiest of all federal agencies. Now, the Friday deadline is quickly bearing down on Congress, and lawmakers are set to leave Washington, D.C., on Thursday for a weeklong recess. Many will head to Germany for the Munich Security Conference. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP Thune said that he would likely tee up another CR on Tuesday, and at the time was optimistic that negotiations were moving in a direction that could lead some Democrats to support the move. ""We will have to vote on something, obviously, if there's additional time that’s needed, and hopefully Democrats will be amenable to doing another — an extension,"" Thune said.

The Republican-led House Committee on Ways and Means is set to hold a hearing on Tuesday morning digging into foreign influence in American nonprofits, with several NGOs and far-left funding networks expected to be on the hot seat. At 10 a.m. on Tuesday, House Committee on Ways and Means Chair Jason Smith will oversee a hearing, ""Foreign Influence in American Non-profits: Unmasking Threats from Beijing and Beyond."" The hearing will be broadcast online at the committee’s website. Witnesses at the hearing will include Capital Research Center president Scott Walter, Americans for Public Trust Executive director Caitlin Sutherland, Narravance CEO Adam Sohn, Dubinsky Consulting founder Bruce Dubinsky and Public Citizen co-founder Robert Weissman. In a press release, the committee said the hearing will focus on the ""ways foreign actors have funneled millions of dollars through networks of tax-exempt organizations to create, support, and fuel disruption and illegal activity across the country."" FAR-LEFT GROUP WITH FOREIGN TIES UNDERMINING US UNDER GUISE OF PROTEST, REPORT WARNS As unrest escalates in Minneapolis, investigators are uncovering a network of far-left activist groups allegedly bankrolled by a wealthy U.S. expat in China with reported ties to Chinese Communist Party–aligned propaganda efforts. (Roberto Schmidt / AFP via Getty Images / Dave Kotinsky/Getty Images for V-Day) The hearing is expected to examine a network of nonprofits, including organizations funded by Neville Roy Singham, an American-born tech tycoon and self-styled Marxist-Leninist, living in Shanghai. Singham has funded nonprofit groups, including the People’s Forum, CodePink, BreakThrough BT Media, the ANSWER Coalition and the Party for Socialism and Liberation, which have worked closely with Democratic Socialists of America in dispatching socialist, Marxist-Leninist and communist foot soldiers into the streets to disrupt federal immigration law enforcement agents and stoke chaos. ""For too long, foreign actors have gotten away with abusing our tax-exempt sector to [sow] division and chaos in our country,"" Smith posted on X on Tuesday morning. ""Today, we’re putting them on notice. Going to be a late night in China for Shanghai Singham!"" Over the past year, Fox News Digital has documented a pattern of coordinated protests by socialist, communist and Marxist groups, revealing a synchronized ecosystem of funding, media amplification, ideological framing and street-level mobilization that aligns with the strategic interests of hostile foreign governments, including the People’s Republic of China. ""Tax-exempt status is a privilege not a right,"" Smith told Fox News Digital. ""Nonprofits must remain accountable and refuse to act as instruments of hostile foreign governments."" CCP-CONNECTED MILLIONAIRE ALLEGEDLY BANKROLLS MINNEAPOLIS AGITATOR GROUPS THROUGH DARK MONEY NETWORK The U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, Jan. 7, 2026. (Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images) The Ways and Means Committee ""continues to investigate how foreign money and foreign-linked networks are funneled through tax-exempt entities to sow discord and unrest in our society,"" he said. ""That’s why we’re demanding answers from Tricontinental and BreakThrough about their funding streams, activities and communications with CCP-linked individuals, including Neville Roy Singham."" Hours before the hearing, Fox News Digital reported that Smith escalated his investigation into Singham, who has allegedly been ""sowing chaos and spreading Chinese propaganda, possibly in coordination with a foreign government."" CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP Rep. Jason Smith, R-Mo., leaves a meeting of the House Republican Conference in the U.S. Capitol. (Tom Williams) In separate letters, Smith demanded records from BreakThrough and Tricontinental, warning that both tax-exempt organizations may be operating outside their lawful purpose as possible unregistered foreign agents, while helping to fuel domestic unrest under the guise of journalism and academic research. Congressional investigators say the Singham network sits at the center of a malign foreign influence operation that allegedly exploits U.S. nonprofit laws to inject anti-American propaganda into domestic protest movements and sow discord from within the United States. The letters describe a full-spectrum operation, with funding aligned with foreign interests flowing into tax-exempt nonprofits that produce ideological research, media narratives and social media messaging, which are then deployed onto U.S. streets through tightly choreographed protests. ""If the evidence shows these groups are acting as conduits for CCP-aligned propaganda or functioning like foreign agents while enjoying U.S. tax benefits, their tax-exempt status should be revoked immediately,"" Smith said. ""We’re going to follow the money and demand accountability to put a stop to Beijing’s exploitation of our tax-exempt sector."" Andrew Mark Miller is a reporter at Fox News.

Fox News contributor Jonathan Turley analyzes a Colombian national's voter fraud conviction, criticizing Chuck Schumer and Kamala Harris on voter ID on ‘America Reports.’ A Colombian woman living in Massachusetts was convicted on a series of federal identity theft and identity fraud charges, including voting illegally in the 2024 presidential election, the Justice Department said. Federal officials have pointed to the case as a rare, documented example of noncitizen voting prosecuted at the highest level, highlighting it amid renewed debate over voter identification, citizenship verification and election security ahead of the 2026 midterms. The Colombian national, Lina Maria Orovio-Hernandez, was convicted on federal charges of identity theft, passport fraud and illegal voting, including in the 2024 presidential election. She was captured on surveillance video displaying an ""I Voted"" sticker on Election Day, underscoring what Justice Department officials characterized as a flagrant disregard for U.S. laws. ""Her actions were not a one-time mistake or accident,"" the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Special Agent in Charge Shawn Rice said in a statement. WATCHDOG SOUNDS ALARM OVER POTENTIAL NONCITIZEN VOTING AND FOREIGN INFLUENCE AHEAD OF MIDTERMS Pam Bondi, U.S. attorney general, speaks during a news conference at the Department of Justice in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, Feb. 12, 2025. (Bloomberg via Getty Images) Officials have highlighted Orovio-Hernandez's case as an example of successful interagency cooperation and enforcement, as election security concerns have intensified in the run-up to the 2026 midterms. The verdict ""sends a clear message: identity theft and fraud against federal benefit programs will not go undetected or unpunished,"" said Amy Connelly, special agent in charge of the Social Security Administration Office of Inspector General in Boston. The Trump administration, for its part, has touted her conviction as an example of the pitfalls of weak voter identification standards or vetting procedures. Officials in several U.S. states have already moved to tighten their individual verification standards and procedures in hopes of cracking down on any fraudulent voting efforts and shoring up voter confidence. SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS PENNSYLVANIA PROVISIONAL BALLOT RULING, IN A MAJOR LOSS FOR GOP Then-candidate President Donald Trump raises his fist during the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on July 15, 2024. (REUTERS/Elizabeth Frantz) The conviction comes amid renewed scrutiny of election administration nationwide, including a recent FBI raid at an election hub in Fulton County, Georgia, that authorized a broad seizure of election records, voting rolls and other data tied to the 2020 election, according to a copy of the warrant. Some Senate Democrats have cited concerns over the news that Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard was present at the raid, though she stressed in a letter obtained by Fox News Digital that the ODNI’s Office of General Counsel ""has found my actions to be consistent and well within my statutory authority as the Director of National Intelligence."" BEHIND-THE-SCENES BATTLES: LEGAL CHALLENGES THAT COULD IMPACT THE VOTE BEFORE ELECTION DAY BEGINS A Spanish-language voting sign is seen at a Denver polling location. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File) The Republican Party has sought to embrace a new, litigation-focused ""election integrity"" strategy in the months ahead of the 2024 general election, as party officials told Fox News Digital at the time. The effort saw dozens of lawsuits that sought to crack down on voter identification laws, tighten citizenship verification standards and add new requirements for mail-in ballots and provisional ballots accepted by certain states.

Ted Cruz R-Texas. joins 'Sunday Morning Futures' to discuss the scale of the Arctic Frost investigation, how cell phone providers Verizon and AT&T responded to subpoenas in the case and more. Phone records of sitting members of Congress were secretly obtained in a way that blocked lawmakers from invoking constitutional protections, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, alleged Tuesday during a hearing. Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., who is leading the hearing, signaled that their panel planned to grill hearing witnesses, who included executives from Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile, about the disclosure of the phone data. Grassley noted in his opening remarks that the three companies received a total of 10 subpoenas for 20 current or former Republican Congress members related to Arctic Frost, the FBI probe that led to Smith bringing charges against President Donald Trump over the 2020 election. JACK SMITH DENIES POLITICS PLAYED ANY ROLE IN TRUMP PROSECUTIONS AT HOUSE HEARING Sen. Chuck Grassley (C) speaks alongside Sen. Bill Hagerty (L), and Sen. Marsha Blackburn (2nd L) as they announce that an FBI whistleblower says the FBI during the Arctic Frost investigation had subpoenaed the records of Republican elected officials in Congress, during a press conference on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., Oct. 6, 2025. (SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images) Blackburn, in her opening remarks, called the disclosures an ""invasion of privacy and violation of our constitutional rights."" Blackburn pointed to the speech or debate clause, which gives Congress members an added layer of protection from prosecution. ""It’s critical that each of these carriers go on the record about the decisions they made and why — or why not — they enabled with Jack Smith’s weaponization of government,"" Blackburn said. Sen. Marsha Blackburn believed that the ""common thread"" in former special counsel Jack Smith's alleged spying on congressional Republicans was their support of President Donald Trump. (Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) The hearing will offer the first public opportunity for Republican committee members, several of whom had a narrow set of their phone data turned over to Smith's team, to seek answers from each of the phone carriers on how they handled the subpoenas upon receiving them. Grassley noted that a federal statute said phone carriers cannot be barred from giving notice to a Senate office about a subpoena unless the member is the target of an investigation. He also said Verizon, in particular, was under a contract that required it to notify the Senate Sergeant at Arms about subpoenas related to senators. The subpoenas were accompanied by court-authorized gag orders, which ordered the phone companies not to alert the senators to the records request. Blackburn, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, are among those on the committee who had their records subpoenaed as part of Arctic Frost.

(Al Drago/Getty Images) While the phone companies come under scrutiny, Grassley also blamed Smith. Smith received the greenlight from DOJ's Public Integrity Section to seek the senators' records as part of his investigation, according to emails, but an official from the section also floated that the subpoenas could expose the DOJ to constitutional challenges. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""Smith and his team irresponsibly steam0rolled ahead while intentionally hiding their activity from Members of Congress. … Smith’s deceitful conduct was a substantial intrusion into the core constitutional activity of constitutional officers,"" Grassley said. Smith, meanwhile, has repeatedly defended the subpoenas, pointing out that they aligned with DOJ policies at the time.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by LSEG. Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chair Rep. Suzan DelBene, in a Fox News Digital interview, says her party will ‘ hold Republicans accountable’ in the 2026 midterm elections. Emboldened congressional Democrats are once again expanding their battleground map for this year's midterm elections, when Republicans will be defending their razor-thin majority in the House. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) on Tuesday added five more offensive opportunities in Colorado, Minnesota, Montana, South Carolina and Virginia to their list of what they consider are vulnerable Republican-held House districts. That brings the total number of districts Democrats are hoping to flip to 44. The DCCC notes that all five of the new districts they're adding to their list of ""offensive targets"" were carried by President Donald Trump by 13 points or fewer in the 2024 elections. Republicans currently control the House by a 218-214 majority, with two right-tilting districts and one left-leaning seat currently vacant. Democrats need a net gain of just three seats in the midterms to win back the majority for the first time in four years. FOX NEWS POLL: AN EARLY LOOK AT THE 2026 MIDTERMS Rep. Suzan DelBene of Washington, the chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, is interviewed by Fox News Digital, on Nov. 19, 2025, in Washington, D.C. (Paul Steinhauser/Fox News) The move by the DCCC comes as Democrats are energized, despite the party's polling woes. Democrats, thanks to their laser focus on affordability amid persistent inflation, scored decisive victories in the 2025 elections and have won or over performed in a slew of scheduled and special ballot box contests since Trump returned to the White House over a year ago. Republicans, meanwhile, are facing traditional political headwinds in which the party in power in the nation’s capital normally suffers setbacks in the midterm elections.

(Evan Vucci/AP Photo) ""Democrats are on offense, and our map reflects the fact that everyday Americans are tired of Republicans' broken promises and ready for change in Congress,"" DCCC Chair Suzan DelBene emphasized in a statement. ""Healthcare, housing, groceries, energy bills — they are all going up, and it's directly because of Republican policies that favor the wealthiest few while leaving hardworking families behind."" HOUSE GOP'S ALREADY FRAGILE MAJORITY TO FURTHER SHRINK AFTER DEMOCRATS' BALLOT BOX VICTORY And DelBene predicted, ""Going into the midterms, Democrats have the winning message, top-tier candidates, and the public on our side, paving the way for a new Democratic House Majority under the leadership of a Speaker Hakeem Jeffries."" But the rival National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) scoffed at the move by the DCCC. ""National Democrats are daydreaming while the ground collapses beneath them. Democrats are getting demolished in the money race, their incumbents are hanging by a thread, and their disastrous primaries are producing unelectable far-left socialists. The battleground favors Republicans,"" NRCC Spokesman Mike Marinella argued in a statement to Fox News Digital.

Brad Finstad and Ryan Zinke are seeking re-election, and Virginia's 5th CD, where Republican Rep. John McGuire is running for another term. The fifth district the DCCC is adding to their target list is the open seat race in South Carolina's 1st CD, where Republican Rep. Nancy Mace is running for governor rather than seeking re-election.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by LSEG. Fox News senior White House correspondent Aishah Hasnie reports on President Donald Trump’s upcoming meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Washington, D.C. on ‘Fox & Friends.’ Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said his country would not negotiate on its ballistic missile program, rejecting a core U.S. demand and further dimming prospects for a breakthrough deal. He again warned in an interview with Al Jazeera that Tehran, Iran, would target U.S. bases in the Middle East if provoked, calling Iran’s missile program ""never negotiable."" The warnings came as U.S. and Iranian negotiators met in early February in Oman, even as Washington continued to build up military forces across the region — a posture U.S. officials say is meant to deter further escalation but which analysts argue also underscores how far apart the two sides remain. Despite the imbalance in military power, analysts say Iran believes it can withstand U.S. pressure by signaling greater resolve — and by betting that Washington’s appetite for war is limited. TRUMP SAYS IRAN ALREADY HAS US TERMS AS MILITARY STRIKE CLOCK TICKS While the U.S. possesses overwhelming military capabilities, Defense Priorities analyst Rosemary Kelanic said Iran is relying on the logic of asymmetric conflict. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said his country would not negotiate on its ballistic missile program, rejecting a core U.S. demand and further dimming prospects for a breakthrough deal. (Vahid Salemi/AP) ""One country is much stronger, but the weaker country cares more,"" Kelanic said. ""And historically, the country that cares more often wins by outlasting the stronger one."" ""Iran is trying to signal resolve as strongly as it can, but it likely doubts U.S. resolve — because from Tehran’s perspective, the stakes for Iran are existential, while the stakes for the United States are not,"" she added. IRAN'S PRESIDENT STRIKES SOFTER TONE ON NUCLEAR TALKS AFTER TRUMP'S WARNING THAT 'BAD THINGS WOULD HAPPEN' Behnam Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said Tehran’s primary leverage is its ability to threaten wider regional instability, even if it cannot win a prolonged conflict. ""The Islamic Republic’s leverage is the threat of a region-wide war,"" Taleblu said, noting that while U.S. and Israeli defenses could intercept most attacks, ""something will get hit."" Analysts across the spectrum agree that Iran is using negotiations less as a path to compromise than as a way to delay decisive action. Oren Kessler, an analyst at global consulting firm Wikistrat, said Iran is using talks to stabilize its position internally while avoiding concessions on core security issues. ""Both sides want a deal, but their red lines are very hard for the other side to overcome,"" Kesler said. ""The talks are going well in the sense that they’re happening, but they’re not really going anywhere."" Taleblu echoed that assessment, arguing that Tehran is treating diplomacy as a shield rather than a solution. ""The regime is treating negotiations as a lifeline rather than a way to resolve the core problem,"" he said. Taleblu added that Iran’s leadership sees talks as a way to deter a strike in the short term, weaken domestic opposition in the medium term, and eventually secure sanctions relief to stabilize its economy. In this frame grab from video obtained by the AP outside Iran, a masked demonstrator holds a picture of Iran's Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi during a protest in Tehran, Iran, Jan. 9, 2026. (UGC via AP) Secretary of State Marco Rubio has insisted that limits on Iran’s ballistic missiles must be part of any agreement to avoid military action. ""At the end of the day, the United States is prepared to engage, and has always been prepared to engage with Iran,"" Rubio said in early February. ""In order for talks to actually lead to something meaningful, they will have to include certain things, and that includes the range of their ballistic missiles. That includes their sponsorship of terrorist organizations across the region. That includes the nuclear program. And that includes the treatment of their own people."" Anti-government protests beginning at the start of 2026 led to a brutal crackdown in Iran. The regime has admitted to 3,117 deaths linked to the demonstrations, though human rights groups and Iranian resistance organizations peg the death toll as much higher. The U.S. also has demanded that Iran give up all enriched uranium stockpiles, which can be used for civilian energy at low levels but for nuclear weapons at higher concentrations. Araghchi told Al Jazeera that Iran is willing to negotiate on nuclear issues but insisted enrichment is an ""inalienable right"" that ""must continue."" Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is pictured sitting next to a senior military official in Iran. (Getty Images) ""We are ready to reach a reassuring agreement on enrichment,"" he said. ""The Iranian nuclear case will only be resolved through negotiations."" Iran’s atomic chief said Monday that Tehran would consider diluting its 60% enriched uranium — a level close to weapons-grade — but only in exchange for the lifting of all sanctions. As negotiations unfolded, the U.S. continued to expand its military footprint in the Middle East. In late January, the U.S. dispatched a carrier strike group centered on the USS Abraham Lincoln to the North Arabian Sea, accompanied by multiple destroyers and other naval assets. Additional F-15E strike aircraft and air defense systems have also been repositioned at bases across the region, alongside thousands of U.S. troops. Taleblu said the administration may be using diplomacy to buy time of its own. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP ""The charitable interpretation is that the president is buying time — moving assets, strengthening missile defense, and preparing military options,"" he said. ""The less charitable interpretation is that the United States is taking Iran’s threats as highly credible and still chasing the optics of a deal."" In 2025, five rounds of talks similarly stalled over U.S. demands that Iran abandon enrichment entirely — talks that ultimately collapsed into Operation Midnight Hammer, a U.S.-led bombing campaign against Iranian nuclear facilities.

The House of Representatives' top Democrat claimed Republicans' election security bill was tantamount to ""voter suppression"" on Monday. House Majority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., criticized the House GOP-led SAVE America Act during his weekly press conference ahead of an expected vote on the bill coming as early as Wednesday. ""Republicans have adopted voter suppression as an electoral strategy. That's what the so-called SAVE Act is all about,"" Jeffries said. He said the bill getting a vote this week is ""worse than"" a previous iteration simply called the Safeguarding American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, which passed the House in April 2025 with support from all Republicans and four Democrats. SCHUMER NUKES GOP PUSH FOR 'JIM CROW-ERA' VOTER ID LAWS IN TRUMP-BACKED SHUTDOWN PACKAGE U.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries speaks during a press conference on Capitol Hill on Nov. 3, 2025 in Washington, D.C. (Roberto Schmidt/Getty Images) The main thrust of the SAVE Act was implementing a new proof of citizenship requirement in the voter registration process in all 50 states. The new bill, led by Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, would also create a federal voter ID standard at the polls, requiring people to show a form of identification when casting a ballot in national elections. Jeffries also pointed to a provision that would require information-sharing between state election officials and federal authorities in verifying citizenship on current voter rolls, accusing Republicans of trying to give Americans' data to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). SCHUMER FACES BACKLASH AFTER CALLING SAVE ACT 'JIM CROW' DESPITE PREVIOUS ALLEGATION FALLING FLAT ""This version, as I understand it, will actually give [the Department of Homeland Security] the power to get voting records from states across the country. Why would these extremists think that's a good idea?"" Jeffries said. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., gestures as he meets with reporters ahead of a key procedural vote to end the partial government shutdown, at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, Feb. 3, 2026. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo) ""Who'd want DHS and ICE, who have been brutally, viciously and violently targeting everyday Americans, to have more data about the American people? It's outrageous. Something is really wrong with these folks. I think they're trying to lose elections at this point."" There is no validated evidence to date that non-citizen voting has swayed the results of any federal election. But Republicans have argued that the influx of illegal immigrants under the Biden administration has made the problem a real possibility in coming elections. Nevertheless, voter ID provisions have proven popular in multiple public surveys. A Pew Research Center poll released in August 2025 showed a whopping 83% of people supported government-issued photo ID requirements for showing up to vote, compared to just 16% of people who disapproved of it. Voters stand in line before casting ballots at a polling location in Dallas, Texas, on Nov. 8, 2022. (Nitashia Johnson/Bloomberg via Getty Images) CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP Jeffries also said the bill would die in the Senate, where at least some Democrats are needed under current rules to overcome a filibuster and advance the legislation. ""It's not going to pass. If it squeaks by the House, it's dead on arrival in the Senate. They're wasting time,"" he said. The real possibility of the bill failing in the Senate is why a group of House conservatives are pushing for Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., to upend the chamber's rules on the filibuster to get rid of the 60-vote threshold needed to overcome one. Thune has not committed to any route. Elizabeth Elkind is a politics reporter for Fox News Digital leading coverage of the House of Representatives.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/02/politics/timeline-us-strikes-caribbean-pacific-vis,A timeline of US strikes on boats that have killed 121,"The US military has killed 121 people in strikes that have destroyed 39 boats as part of a campaign that Washington says is aimed at curtailing the flow of drugs into the United States. There have been several survivors of those strikes, two of whom were briefly detained by the US Navy before being returned to their home countries. Another is presumed dead after a search by the Mexican Navy. The US Coast Guard launched a search for an unspecified number of survivors who abandoned ship before their vessels were struck on December 30 in international waters. The Coast Guard suspended its search on January 2. The Coast Guard launched another search for a survivor of a boat strike on January 23. The Trump administration has told Congress that the US is now in an “armed conflict” against drug cartels beginning with its first strike on September 2, labeling those killed “unlawful combatants” and claiming the ability to engage in lethal strikes without judicial review due to a classified Justice Department finding. Some members of Congress as well as human rights groups have questioned that finding and argued that potential drug traffickers should face prosecution, as had been the policy of interdiction carried out by the US before President Donald Trump took office. The Trump administration has also not provided public evidence of the presence of narcotics on the boats struck, nor their affiliation with drug cartels. Military officials have said that no US service members have been harmed in the strikes. This story has been updated with additional reporting. © 2026 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/18/politics/tammy-bruce-anti-muslim-commentary-un-kfile,Trump pick for deputy UN job questioned loyalty of American Muslims,"President Donald Trump’s pick to be the US deputy representative to the United Nations, former Fox News contributor Tammy Bruce, for years promoted inflammatory, anti-Muslim and conspiratorial claims, including suggesting that former President Barack Obama was a secret Muslim bent on harming America. A CNN KFile review of Bruce’s blog posts, social media posts, columns and radio commentaries starting in the early 2000s shows a pattern of demeaning language about Muslims, including suggesting that American Muslims needed to prove their loyalty after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Other comments targeted Muslim-majority countries Bruce would have to work with at the UN. Many of these statements were published between the early 2000s and late 2010s on her personal blog, which is no longer online. But they were preserved through the Internet Archive and independent watchdog groups that monitor conservative media. Bruce, currently the chief spokesperson for the State Department, was nominated for the high-level diplomatic post in August. Her nomination was formally sent to the Senate in September, and her confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled for Wednesday. “Tammy Bruce will represent our Country brilliantly at the United Nations,” Trump announced on Truth Social in August. Bruce did not respond to CNN’s request for comment. In a statement to CNN, a White House spokesperson said, “Tammy Bruce was an effective Spokesperson for the State Department because of her steadfast loyalty to President Trump, which makes her an effective voice for the President and administration’s views on important issues.” Speaking of then-President Obama, Bruce referred to Obama as a “Kenyan,” “idiot,” and “dumb bastard,” in posts dating back to 2010. She falsely suggested he was Muslim, at one point saying that Obama had “compulsion to confess” he was Muslim when during a 2008 ABC interview Obama accidentally said “my Muslim faith” while discussing rumors about him. George Stephanopoulos immediately corrected him, and Obama instantly clarified “my Christian faith.” She also raised questions about his birth certificate. “Somewhere in Kenya a village is missing its idiot,” she added in one of multiple comments on her personal blog. A former liberal turned conservative radio host, Bruce argued in multiple writings reviewed by CNN that the US was overly deferential toward American Muslims who needed to prove their loyalty. “Since the attacks on our country, we have indeed been kissing the proverbial derriere of the American Muslim establishment, and it’s time we stopped,” she wrote in July 2002. “It is now their turn to do the right thing and go out of their way to show us that they are American – first and foremost.” “(The) Muslim establishment in this country should be tripping over themselves to prove they’re with us and are loyal and sympathetic,” she added. Her nomination also comes at a time when the US is working with Muslim-majority countries on the crisis in Gaza, something that could potentially be complicated by Bruce’s harsh anti-Muslim language, which included calls for regime change in Saudi Arabia and referring to its ruling family as “beasts.” In a 2002 column, Bruce recounted an appearance by Queen Noor of Jordan on CNN’s “Larry King Live” in the weeks following the September 11 attacks. Bruce wrote that King asked the queen — an American-born Christian who converted to Islam — what Americans could do to show Muslims around the world that “we’re not bad people,” calling it “a reasonable question.” “The appropriate question to her would have been how can you convince us that Muslims aren’t bad people? After all, it was a reasonable question after September 11, and it oddly remains the question as we continue to give the Muslim establishment a free pass in our efforts to prove we aren’t racist.” “It’s time we get off our knees and make it clear to the American-Muslim establishment that we have a few requirements of our own, and that it’s time they put up as American-first or shut up, and perhaps even get out if they haven’t bothered to renew their visas,” Bruce added. “From what I’ve seen, the fat-cat Muslim Elite in this country are indeed loyal – just not to the United States,” she later concluded. Bruce’s nomination comes amidst Trump’s long-running feud with the United Nations, in which he has questioned the efficacy of its organization and financial commitments. Bruce herself has criticized the UN in even harsher terms than the president. In posts from 2006, she attacked the UN, frequently referring to it as America’s “enemy.” She also called it a failure for its “financial corruption…ignoring of genocide, and the Jew-hatred at its core” and called to “tear down the UN.” Bruce also called the so-called “Ground Zero mosque” proposal a symbol of Muslim conquest. “There’s only one group of people who were mass murdered on 9/11 and that was Americans, not Muslims,” she wrote in 2010 while opposing plans to build an Islamic community center near Ground Zero — a project critics at the time derisively labeled the “Ground Zero mosque.” The so-called “Ground Zero mosque” was never built as planned. After the backlash, the site was repurposed for a condo project that later stalled amid financial and legal setbacks. “I’m convinced this mosque was Obama’s idea,” she added. “The notion of it and its location. I think he knows he’ll be a one-term president and wants as much destruction to the American psyche as possible. The legacy this man is now establishing is a continuation of the terrorism unleashed in the 90s and defined by 9/11.” Another 2002 column discussed the case of Eunice Stone, a Georgia woman who called police after saying she overheard three Muslim men joking about 9/11 and talking about a terrorist attack. The report sparked a major police response, including shutting down a highway, but authorities later said there was no evidence of terrorism and released the men. Bruce praised Stone as a “true American” and attacked the men. “Being an American is a frame of mind, which includes commitment and loyalty,” she wrote, suggesting that the men — despite the two being US citizens — lacked both. Other posts attacked the Empire State Building for lighting up green to mark the Muslim holy month of Ramadan in 2007, calling it an insult to Americans who died during the September 11th attacks. “Yes, you heard me right,” she wrote. “Now the tallest building in New York, because Islamists knocked down the other two tallest buildings in New York in their act of mass murder, will be commemorating the end of Ramadan by going green from Friday through Sunday. This must stop. This act is an insult to every who dies on September 11, but to the 4,000 plus who have died fighting Islamists since then.” Bruce continued, “all this pandering sends a message to the enemy and everyone else that we must feel guilty about something, which of course, confirms in the minds of the genocidal enemy that they’re right to kill us.” In a 2010 radio broadcast, Bruce said Obama’s election represented a possible “first surrender,” in the eyes of Muslims. “(W)hat kind of resistance will the American people put forward now that we’ve got a guy named Barack Hussein Obama in the White House, maybe they’re thinking that was the first surrender and because this guy’s gonna be a one term president, this is a major push to one, to just punch the Americans in the face one more time to see what they’ll do,” Bruce said in 2010. In another episode in 2010, Bruce, referring to Obama as “Urkel,” said she wouldn’t put it past Obama to secretly want America harmed by nuclear material from North Korea. “Now maybe I’m naïve of thinking that the military’s gonna be able to keep a really bad thing from happening if ‘Urkel’ does not have the courage – or even perhaps secretly wishes this nation to be harmed,” she said. “I wouldn’t put that past him. His mother certainly did. His friends certainly do. Why would he be out of that loop? I’m just looking at the facts as we know them.” Bruce also frequently criticized Saudi Arabia and its “so-called royal family,” referring to them as “beasts” and “tyrants.” In a post from August 2007 she wrote, “Saudi Arabia is the enemy, in so may [sic] ways. For us to continue to support this monstrous regime is unconscionable. The Saudis, which includes the so-called ‘royal’ family and the religious elite (the cancerous Wahabbist terrorist enemy) both need to be vanquished from this earth.” Bruce also targeted the Bush administration for its friendly ties to Saudi Arabia, once referring to the regime as “Laura Bush’s friends” and criticizing the administration for being “completely supportive” of a nation that reportedly sentenced a rape victim to 200 lashes and six months in prison.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/23/politics/what-voters-say-they-want-for-christmas,What voters say they want for Christmas,"One big thing dominates Tonya Rincon’s holiday wish list, and she is willing to wait nearly a year to get it: “Democrats retake the House.” Billy Pierce has a very different end-of-the-year ask: “More Republican control.” Political opposites, they are closing 2025 as they did 2024: on each side of America’s Donald Trump divide. Pierce, a retiree and part-time consultant in South Carolina, rated Trump’s first year back in the White House an 8 out of 10. Rincon, a Michigander who retired last year from the Ford Motor Company, graded the president a 1. (Zero was not an option.) “Better,” is how Pierce rated his standard of living since Trump returned to the presidency 11 months ago. “Slightly worse,” Rincon answered. Both are voters participating in our All Over the Map project. We began the project 28 months ago with a handful of voters in Iowa and now keep in touch, so far, with roughly 150 voters spread across 17 states. Polarization has been a constant since Trump took center stage in American politics, so it was no surprise that our end-of-the-year survey showed the fierce divide over the president persists. In some ways, that divide has seemed to widen since his return to office. “I think President Trump is doing an amazing job,” said Pam Aita, a Pennsylvania retiree who lives in bellwether Northampton County. “Narcissistic sociopath,” was the quite different assessment of Trump from Darrell Ann Murphy, a retiree who regularly plays mahjong with Aita despite their vastly different views on the president and his performance. “He is the worst at everything,” said Zoila Sanchez, a Las Vegas real estate agent who considers herself a Reagan Republican and cannot stomach Trump. “He is working very hard to bring jobs back to the country,” said Joseph Knowles, a Michigan autoworker. “He is not focused on America — he is focused on himself,” said Claudio Rodriguez, a community organizer and food bank worker in Arizona. “So much for ‘America First.’” Beyond the reflexive Trump divide, though, the survey did provide several interesting takeaways. Some may be instructive about the midterm election climate, at least at this beginning stage. Others offer insight as we inch toward a giant and unpredictable transition: The Republican Party’s search for a new leader after three consecutive presidential elections with Trump atop the ticket. There is also the Democrats’ identity crisis, which remains an issue, though it was masked somewhat by the anti-Trump sentiment that powered Democrats to a string of important 2025 election victories. Some highlights from the survey are below. Cost of living was a bipartisan concern. Democrats in our voter survey said Trump broke a promise to bring costs down quickly; Republicans tended to be more patient, even as most reported their costs are at least somewhat higher in 2025 than 2024. “It’s worse,” said Kim Cavaliere, an independent who lives in Georgia. “So I am supposed to be excited because egg prices went down.” Fact check: Grocery prices are up, not ‘way down’ as Trump claimed Rincon was one of many voters who planned to spend the same or less this holiday season, she said, “since groceries and utilities are higher.” Manhattan nurse Lal Lopez, a liberal Democrat, said she has taken on a third job to help pay the bills. Chantá Villano-Willis, a Georgia Democrat turned independent, said 2025 was a year of high prices for goods and services. “I am not happy about my rise in health insurance premiums,” she added. “Small businesses are hurting,” said Catherine Long, a Democrat and retiree in Pennsylvania. “Restaurant prices are skyrocketing.” Aita was among the Trump voters urging patience. “You can’t flip the standard of living in 11 months,” she said. Chris Mudd, an Iowa Trump voter, saw his solar energy business take a hit as Biden-era green energy incentives expired. “Losing tax credits has had a big negative impact on our business, but I trust things will improve,” Mudd said. “The cost of energy is still too high.” Devin McIver, a heavy equipment operator and Trump voter in New Hampshire, took a proactive approach to managing the big 2025 economic changes. “I’m still able to get the things I need at affordable prices,” he said. “However, I am not buying out of Canada due to tariffs. Or any other place with high tariffs.” The Democratic voters we surveyed were unanimous in their outrage over the Trump administration’s deportation tactics. “It is a stain on our country,” said Carey Fulks Jr., an Atlanta Democrat. “Way too aggressive and inhumane,” said Angela Lang, a community organizer in Milwaukee. “There is no grace,” said Rodriguez, the Harris voter in Tucson. “There is no transparency concerning the background of those picked up,” said Lawrence Malinconico, a Pennsylvania college professor and fierce Trump critic. This US citizen went on his lunch break and ended up in a chokehold by a masked federal agent and detained, video shows Several of the Trump voters also voiced concerns the White House was going too far, even as they said tougher enforcement was long overdue. Max Scheske is a member of the University of Michigan College Republicans but not a Trump fan. “He closed the border, which is good,” Scheske said. “But there is zero reason to be making these provocative deportation videos.” The promise of tougher immigration enforcement was one of the reasons Iowa’s Mudd was an early Trump supporter back in 2015. “Hard to watch, to be honest,” he said of the administration’s aggressive deportation tactics. “But enforcing the laws that have not been enforced is a shock to the system. Too many (administrations) looked the other way for too long.” This is both an obvious and critical dynamic. Progressive energy powered the Democratic Party’s impressive 2025 election wins and is essential for the party now that the consequential 2026 midterms are approaching. In a close 2025 defeat, Democrats see the beginnings of a 2026 red-state surprise Trump “has complete contempt for democracy as well as the international laws of war,” said Anna St. Clair, a Manhattan public relations worker. “The president is incompetent, racist, misogynist and money-hungry,” said Fulks, the Atlanta voter. Pat Levin, a 95-year-old Pennsylvania Democrat, hopes 2026 opposition to Trump includes flipping her congressional district blue and ending the GOP House majority. “Under his tyranny, higher education has become politicized,” said Levin. “He is leading us into moral bankruptcy.” This jumped out reading the survey responses. Voters who love Trump and voters who loathe him share a distrust and disaffection toward the government more generally. Pennsylvania Trump voter Aita’s recommendation: “Term limits for Congress and the Supreme Court.” “Term limits and age limits for Congress,” said Rodriguez, the Arizona progressive. “Term limits,” said New Hampshire Trump backer McIver, when asked what would improve America’s political discourse. “Limited tenure for elected officials and Supreme Court justices,” said Brian McMutuary, a restaurant manager in Wisconsin. Cavaliere, the Georgia independent, offered this suggestion: “That it is mandatory that the president be between the ages of 40-65 and you have to have military experience.” And this desire came from Wahbeh Nuseibeh, a Democratic-leaning voter in the Detroit suburbs: “New leadership across the board.” Like the calls for reforms, the desire for less animosity in politics was a bipartisan appeal. “Less personal shots toward one another,” was an ask from Knowles, the auto worker and Trump voter in Michigan. Shanen Ebersole, a cattle farmer and Trump supporter in Iowa, said the president should do more to lower the temperature. “I wish he would be a little more encouraging for all of us to get along together,” she said. Joan London is an attorney in Berks County, Pennsylvania, and an independent now because she felt she could not remain in the Republican Party led by Trump. Her wish is consistent. “We need a viable center back in our politics,” London said. “Most of the electorate is not extreme.” © 2026 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/11/politics/kfile-kathy-ruemmler-epstein-emails-epstein-files-invs-vis,‘Rehashed crap’: Former Obama White House attorney dismissed report on abuse allegations and advised  Epstein media strategy,"When billionaire sex offender Jeffrey Epstein needed legal advice, help responding to negative press, or just moral support, he often turned to an unexpected confidante – Kathy Ruemmler, an elite attorney who served two US presidents and was once a top candidate for US attorney general. As thousands of new documents tied to Epstein have been released, many of those closest to him have paid a steep price for their friendship by forfeiting influential jobs and weathering fierce public blowback. Yet Ruemmler, a former White House counsel for Barack Obama, has maintained a prestigious post as chief legal officer for Goldman Sachs. The bank has continued to stand by her — even as emails show Epstein calling her “my great defender” and seeking her help pushing back on reports detailing his abuse of underage girls. A CNN KFile review of Epstein’s emails and travel schedules sheds new light on his relationship with the power-broking lawyer and shows that their ties went far beyond professional advice and into the realm of a friendship. Among the many high-profile and notable names that appear in the Epstein messages, Ruemmler is one of the most frequently referenced, with more than 100 exchanges between her and Epstein over several years. Epstein’s schedule reveals that he was set to meet with Ruemmler more than 50 times between July 2014 and May 2019, including for lunches and dinners with celebrities, apartment hunting, and personal beauty appointments. As early as 2014, the year that Ruemmler left the Obama White House, the pair already appeared close, with Ruemmler telling Epstein in one email, “I’ll be here all week — you may get sick of me.” In a statement to CNN, Ruemmler said, “In 2014, I barely knew Jeffrey Epstein. My remark was a throwaway line in response to his invitation to attend multiple meetings with business contacts.” Across the many messages, Ruemmler emerges as a confidant and advocate for Epstein, at times helping him manage his public reputation following his 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor. Epstein’s estate is fighting to keep hundreds of additional emails between Ruemmler and Epstein private, arguing that they are protected by attorney-client privilege. The privilege log shows that Ruemmler continued to communicate with Epstein through at least June 2019 and suggests she was more involved with Epstein’s legal affairs than previously known. Inside Jeffrey Epstein’s web of power, revealed in new emails In 2023, Ruemmler told the Wall Street Journal, “I regret ever knowing Jeffrey Epstein.” In a statement to CNN, Ruemmler referred to Epstein as a “business referral source” when she was at the law firm Latham & Watkins and that she knew him in a “professional capacity” when she served as head of the white collar defense group at the firm. But she said she “did not represent him and was not compensated by him.” CNN sent a series of questions to Ruemmler and Goldman Sachs prior to publication. Ruemmler provided answers to several of them, but others she declined to directly answer — including whether she was involved with drafting a public relations statement for Epstein or took part in discussions to help him respond to media inquiries about his sexual abuse. “I was one of a number of lawyers Epstein informally reached out to for advice,” Ruemmler said in her statement to CNN. “I had no knowledge of any new or ongoing unlawful activity on his part.” In one email between Epstein and Ruemmler from June 2018 released by the House Oversight Committee, Ruemmler dismissed reporting on Epstein’s abuse of underage girls as “a novella of rehashed crap,” sending a follow-up email that just said “ugh.” Ruemmler in a statement to CNN said she was referring to the article as crap but not the allegations. “The article struck me at the time as largely a compilation of prior reporting. I was obviously referring to the reporting, not the allegations of any victims,” Ruemmler said. “I have deep sympathy for anyone victimized by Epstein, and as I have said many times, I regret ever knowing him.” In 2019, as major outlets reexamined Epstein’s long history of sexually abusing minors, he invoked her advice directly. In a text message from that year, Epstein said Ruemmler helped him craft a public-relations statement in response to a forthcoming Washington Post editorial calling for Congress to investigate him. At 4 a.m. on March 7, 2019, Epstein texted a draft statement to a contact redacted by House investigators, calling it a “Ruemmler proposal” and writing, “this is what Kathy suggests we tell Waco,” correcting the typo seconds later to “Wapo.” The statement — which Epstein said Ruemmler provided — rejected claims he received a “sweetheart deal” in his 2008 conviction and argued prosecutors had pursued him too aggressively. “The criticism is wrong and reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of both [the] facts underlying Mr. Epstein’s case and how it was prosecuted by both local and federal authorities. Far from a receiving a sweetheart deal, Mr. Epstein was subjected to a lengthy, aggressive, and highly unusual federal investigation for what were, in essence, local offenses of sexual solicitation. He accepted responsibility, served time and prison, and paid significant monetary settlements to the victims involved,” said the statement. An editorial from the Washington Post’s editorial board later that day read, “How did Jeffrey Epstein get away with it? Congress should inquire,” but included no statement from Epstein. The Epstein estate’s privilege log shows that Ruemmler emailed Epstein about the Washington Post editorial the day it was published in March 2019. Another exchange from a few months earlier in December 2018 suggests that Ruemmler may also have been involved in discussions about how to respond to a Miami Herald 2018 investigation into Epstein’s abuse of underage girls. In a series of messages with journalist Michael Wolff, Epstein refers to someone named “Kathy” while weighing whether to push back on the reporting. “Kathy thought the piece is being lauded as great investigative journalism so does your suggested PR group have the better contacts to place a story on why it is not,” Epstein wrote. Wolff appeared to invoke Ruemmler as well, replying that any response “has to be war gamed out,” adding, “Obviously I can contribute, Kathy can.” As the fallout from the Epstein files continues, many of those revealed to be his close associates in his web of power are facing blowback. Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly known as Prince Andrew, was stripped of his royal titles. Former Treasury secretary and Harvard University president Larry Summers stepped aside from teaching and was banned for life from a prestigious economic association. But Ruemmler has managed to fly under the radar despite working as the top lawyer for one of the world’s largest banks, where she made $22.5 million last year. Goldman Sachs has stood by Ruemmler, with their CEO David Solomon telling CNBC in mid-November that Ruemmler is “an excellent lawyer, and the organization relies on her guidance every single day.” The bank has said her relationship with Epstein was purely professional. “As we’ve said before, and has been repeatedly reported, Ms. Ruemmler had a professional relationship with Mr. Epstein when she was at Latham & Watkins,” the company told the Washington Post. In a statement to CNN, Goldman Sachs said, “Epstein referred business to Kathy, including a European bank he advised that became a client at Latham & Watkins. This naturally involved meetings and gatherings, including with other prospective clients, as occurred with other business associates.” Ruemmler, 54, has enjoyed a sterling legal career. After graduating from Georgetown Law and serving as an associate counsel to President Bill Clinton, she cut her teeth as a young federal prosecutor in the US Attorney’s Office in DC. She joined the Justice Department’s Enron Task Force, which successfully prosecuted top executives of the energy trading company for fraud. She then worked in private practice before joining the Obama administration as White House counsel. Ruemmler emerged as one of Obama’s legal defenders of his signature policy, the Affordable Care Act. After leaving the White House in mid-2014, Ruemmler returned to private practice at Latham & Watkins. She joined Goldman Sachs in 2020 where she is now the co-vice chair of the firm’s reputational risk committee – which determines which clients the bank should and shouldn’t work with. A spokesperson for Goldman Sachs said she met Epstein through her work in private practice at Latham & Watkins. The law firm said Epstein was never a client. Epstein appears to have trusted Ruemmler so much that he relied on her as a character witness. In 2017, Epstein invoked Ruemmler in his efforts to connect with tech billionaire Bill Gates, whose then-wife, Melinda Gates, wouldn’t allow it given Epstein’s reputation as a convicted sex offender. “He wants to talk to you but his wife won’t let him,” read a text message to Epstein from a redacted user in late January 2017. Epstein then suggested Melinda connect with Ruemmler to assuage her. “Bill met my friend Kathy ruemmler, Obama counsel for 5 yrs. She would love to sit with Melinda and give her the other side of jeffrey,” Epstein wrote, adding, “she is an arch feminist who is my great defender.” Ruemmler in a statement said she never met with Melinda Gates. “I have no control over how Epstein characterized me or our interactions. I was not his defender. I never advocated on his behalf with any third party – not Melinda Gates, not the press, not a court, not a government official,” Ruemmler said. Representatives of both Bill and Melinda Gates did not respond to requests for comment. But the exchange offers a revealing window into Epstein’s relationship with Ruemmler and how he discussed her with others. Ruemmler was listed as a backup executor of a January 2019 version of Epstein’s will, according to a disclosure from Congress first reported by the Wall Street Journal. “I have nothing to do with the estate and have never served in any capacity relating to the estate,” Ruemmler said at the time. She was reportedly also seen in the courtroom for Epstein’s arraignment hearing after his July 2019 arrest, sitting behind his legal team. The correspondence between Epstein and Ruemmler suggests a relationship far more intertwined than previously known. Emails and schedules show Ruemmler discussing articles, career advice, political developments, travel, dinners, and logistics with Epstein; being invited to — and in some instances scheduled for — dozens of meetings; and even having personal beauty appointments, including facials and a “Glam Squad” session, noted in Epstein’s calendars. “Reminder: Kathy Ruemmler to see [redacted] today for a facial at 1pm,” read one entry from March 2016. Another entry read, “Reminder: Kathy Ruemmler to have the Glam Squad to her NY apt at 9am!” from February 2018. The exchanges between Epstein and Ruemmler frequently drifted far beyond anything resembling a conventional, transactional attorney–client relationship. They demonstrate a friendly, at times playful, rapport that is remarkably casual and frank given Epstein’s 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor. According to at least one former high ranking official at Goldman Sachs, the firm was aware of Ruemmler’s relationship with Epstein when she was hired, pointing to an article that ran in the Daily Beast in 2020 detailing her appearance at his arraignment in 2019 for sex charges related to his repeated abuse and trafficking of minors. “She clearly was friends with him,” the source said, adding explanations that she gave for her ties to him no longer made sense with the new revelations. “I would feel burned if I was them.” In one exchange with Ruemmler, Epstein appeared to make light of his 2008 conviction. In a 2014 thread that appeared to discuss Ruemmler as a possible nominee for attorney general, she wrote to him, “Most girls do not have to worry about this crap.” Epstein replied: “‘girls?’ careful i will renew an old habit.” Ruemmler did not appear to respond directly to that remark. In another email, Ruemmler wrote about a road trip on the New Jersey Turnpike when driving to New York. “Going up to NY Friday morning,” she wrote. “Think I am going to drive. I will then stop to pee and get gas at a rest stop on the New Jersey turnpike, will observe all of the people there who are at least 100 pounds overweight, will have a mild panic attack as a result of the observation, and will then decide that I am not eating another bite of food for the rest of my life out of fear that I will end up like one of these people.” “Ok, anytime you like, you can drive right to me and i will feed you,” Epstein replied, adding a smiley face. “Great,” responded Ruemmler. Many of the entries in his schedule mentioning Ruemmler were labeled as “appointments”; others noted “lunch” or “dinner” with Ruemmler and sometimes with other figures such as Peter Thiel, Woody Allen, Steve Bannon and Bill Gates. “I’m sitting here with Kathy Rummer,” Epstein said in one text message, misspelling her surname. “If you have any questions.” “I did not travel with him, go out to dinner with him, or spend time with him one-on-one except in a professional setting. As has been well established, Epstein’s calendars and schedules often do not reflect reality,” said Ruemmler in her statement to CNN.

Become a member and help keep fearless reporting independent. Already a member? Log in to hide these messages. ""What's happening in Minnesota is wrong. There's no shades of grey. It's clear,"" Rich Ruohonen said at Milan Cortina 2026. CORTINA D’AMPEZZO, Italy, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Curler Rich Ruohonen became the latest U.S. athlete to weigh into domestic politics on Tuesday, condemning immigration sweeps in his home state of Minnesota that is a hotbed for the sport. Various American athletes at the Winter Games have spoken out over events back home, with skier Hunter Hess labelled a “real loser” by an irritated U.S. President Donald Trump. “I’d like to say I’m proud to be here to represent Team USA, and to represent our country. But we’d be remiss if we didn’t at least mention what’s going on in Minnesota,” said Ruohonen, a 54-year-old personal injury lawyer who works in Minnesota. “What a tough time it’s been for everybody. This stuff is happening right around where we live,” he added in a statement at the end of a press conference. Protests have been taking place around Minnesota after Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents killed two U.S. citizens as part of Trump’s push against illegal immigration. “I am a lawyer, as you know. We have a constitution, and it allows us freedom of speech,” Ruohonen went on. “It protects us from unreasonable searches and seizures. And makes it that we have to have probable cause to be pulled over. What’s happening in Minnesota is wrong. There’s no shades of grey. It’s clear.” CURLING STRONGHOLD Minnesota is a curling stronghold in the U.S. and has produced a number of Olympic competitors including John Shuster, who skipped the men’s team to gold at the 2018 Pyeongchang Games. Ruohonen, an alternate for the men’s team, said he was proud of the public expressions in his home. “I really love what’s been happening there now. With people coming out, showing the love, the compassion, the integrity and respect for others that they don’t know, and helping them out,” he said. “We love Minnesota for that ... We love our country. We’re playing for the U.S. We’re playing for each other, we’re playing for our family and our friends that sacrificed so much to get here today.” The Olympics, he said, embody the same values as those shown by compatriots in Minnesota. “What the Olympics means is excellence, respect, friendship. We all, I think, exemplify that. We are playing for the people of Minnesota and the people around the country who share those same values, that compassion, that love, and that respect.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) if he saw anything inappropriate during his time with the deceased financier, Lutnick said, “The only thing I saw…was staff who worked for Mr. Epstein on that island.” Lutnick, a billionaire businessman, is facing bipartisan calls to resign from the Trump administration after emails released by the Department of Justice showed he had ties to Epstein even after he was convicted in 2008 on charges of trafficking minors. “Really, he should make life easier on the president, frankly, and just resign,” Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) told CNN. After meeting with Epstein in 2005, Lutnick said he vowed to “never be in a room with that disgusting person ever again.” And he told The New York Post last year that after leaving his former neighbor’s house at the time, “my wife and I decided that I will never be in the room with that disgusting person ever again.” But Lutnick had discussed traveling to Epstein’s island in 2012 emails, according to some of the newly released documents. And his wife was with him when he eventually made the trip, according to Lutnick’s latest testimony. “My wife was with me, as were my four children, and nannies,” Lutnick said Tuesday. “I had another couple, they were there as well, their children, and we had lunch on the island.” Van Hollen told Lutnick on Tuesday that he “totally misrepresented” the extent of his relationship with Epstein. “The information recently revealed shows that you had interactions with Epstein over 13 years, including long after he was convicted of soliciting the prostitution of a minor,” Van Hollen added. “That does call into question your credibility and fitness for the job.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Your membership allows us to name harmful rhetoric, provide context, and report with integrity—standing up for truth and accountability. Already a member? Log in to hide these messages. Right-wingers were distressed after singer Coco Jones performed a rendition of ""Lift Every Voice and Sing."" Experts in Black history would like a word. Senior Reporter, Life Trends Many MAGA supporters are complaining that a performance of the hymn “Lift Every Voice and Sing” — known as the Black national anthem — was included at the pregame ceremony at Super Bowl 2026 on Sunday. But experts in Black history and racial equity emphasize that the critics are missing the point of the historical song. Grammy award-winning singer Coco Jones was widely praised online for delivering a stunning performance of the Black national anthem during the Super Bowl festivities. Many also celebrated the “ICU” singer for paying homage to Whitney Houston with an ensemble inspired by the tracksuit Houston wore to perform “The Star-Spangled Banner” at the 1991 Super Bowl. But Jones’ powerful rendition did little to quell the right-wing outrage that the Black national anthem was featured in the pregame ceremony — or that the song exists at all — as some X users accused the hymn of being “divisive.” “The United States of America has ONLY ONE National Anthem,” one X user wrote. “Kicking off the #SuperBowl in the year of our great nation’s 250th birthday, with the ‘Black National Anthem’, is a disgrace & racially divisive…” “No such thing as the black national anthem….” wrote another. But as scholars in history and African-American studies have pointed out over the years, “Lift Every Voice and Sing” is not about divisiveness; it’s about the history of the Black American experience and hope for the future. And critics of the hymn seem to be missing one crucial point: Black history is American history. “If Black History is American history, it cannot be divisive,” said LaGarrett King, professor of social studies education and director of the Center for K–12 Black History and Racial Literacy Education at the Graduate School of Education at the University at Buffalo. “The song is important to our imperfect history, and it is OK if we citizens are reminded of it from time to time,” he told HuffPost. “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” written as a poem by James Weldon Johnson and composed by his brother, Rosamond Johnson, was first performed publicly by children at a school celebration in 1900, according to the Library of Congress. The NAACP adopted the hymn as the Black national anthem in 1919, long before the “Star Spangled Banner” became the official national anthem of the U.S. in 1931. The National Football League began featuring performances of the song at the Super Bowl in 2021 — and conservatives have been furious since. Last year, MAGA fans similarly complained after Grammy winner Ledisi performed the hymn at the 2025 pregame ceremony, alongside a choir of 125 high school students from the Greater New Orleans High School Chorale Collective. The year before, right-wing pundit Megyn Kelly aired her grievances about the anthem — saying it did “not belong at the Super Bowl.” King said that while the NFL hosting performances of “Lift Every Voice and Sing” ahead of the Super Bowl game is “largely symbolic,” it can still honor Black players, who, he points out, “represent over half of the NFL.” “The national anthem does little to honor them given its history,” he said. King pointed to the longstanding criticism that certain lyrics of “The Star-Spangled Banner,” written by Francis Scott Key, are racist. “It must be understood that the National Anthem had racist undertones within the third stanza,” he said. “The author was a slave owner and believed in the institutions of slavery. He also used his position as Washington D.C’s district attorney to defend slavery and restrict abolitionist speech even wanting to hang/charge [someone] who possessed abolitionist literature.” “Therefore, I could ask why would we as Americans want to support such a man with the honor [of] our national anthem, if we would like to disassociate ourselves from our racist past?” King questioned, before adding, “It is evident that the National Anthem was not written for Black citizens.” “So, we can ask, which anthem is really divisive?” he said. Shaun Harper, a professor of business, public policy and education at the University of Southern California, said that “Black people make the most money for the NFL every season,” considering the racial demographics of the players of the league. “Given this, there should be absolutely no resistance to the singing of an anthem that affirms their history and identities as Americans,” he said. “Do critics realize or even care that the Super Bowl is always played during Black History Month?” Harper later asked. “How did ‘Lift Every Voice and Sing,’ a soul-stirring anthem written 126 years ago, suddenly become divisive?” “I would not be surprised if conservatives start claiming that Martin Luther King Day, Juneteenth and Black History Month also are divisive,” he added. “It is important to understand that our country is diverse and is not a white nation, [or] that only white symbolism matters.” “Lift Every Voice and Sing” is often sung at schools, churches and at historically Black colleges and universities. King said that he’s always believed the backlash to the Black national anthem was rooted in ignorance about its history — and that it seems that MAGA supporters believe there is a hierarchy of “‘Americanism,’ meaning that American symbols are sacred and no other approaches to citizenship or celebrations should be adopted or portrayed within American institutions.” “The song is symbolic of Black unity and resistance to those acts that are oppressive. The song resembles the American story,” he said. “It is important to understand that our country is diverse and is not a white nation, [or] that only white symbolism matters. We cannot force patriotism, especially by resisting cultural histories that have lasted for over a century.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Raskin Confirms ‘Troubling’ And ‘Unnecessary’ Epstein File Redactions,"Stand with a newsroom that doesn’t flinch. Become a member and help keep fearless reporting independent. Already a member? Log in to hide these messages. The House Judiciary Committee member reviewed some unredacted Epstein files Monday — and came away troubled. Senior Reporter The top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee reviewed unredacted versions of the Epstein files on Monday, and he came away deeply troubled, he told reporters. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said the Justice Department appeared to be in violation of a provision of the Epstein Files Transparency Act that both requires survivors’ privacy not be compromised and prohibits the DOJ from redacting the names of Jeffrey Epstein’s accomplices. The financier was facing charges of sex trafficking when he died in jail in 2019. “I was able to determine, at least I believe, that there were tons of unnecessary redactions in addition to the failure to redact the names of victims. And so that’s troubling to us,” he said. “I saw the names of lots of people who were redacted for mysterious or baffling or inscrutable reasons.” Asked for an example, Raskin said he reviewed an email sent from Epstein to co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell that was itself a forwarded conversation between Epstein’s lawyers and lawyers for Donald Trump. “Epstein’s lawyers synopsized and quoted Trump as saying that Jeffrey Epstein was not a member of his club at Mar-a-Lago — but he was a guest at Mar-a-Lago and he had never been asked to leave. And that was redacted for some …inscrutable reason.” Raskin then noted that the account undercuts Trump’s own repeated claims to have asked Epstein to leave and proceeded to accuse the DOJ under Trump of covering up the crimes of powerful people. “I think the Department of Justice has been in cover-up mode for many months and has been trying to sweep the entire thing under the rug,” he warned, noting he’d only had time Monday morning to review 30 or 40 documents of the 3 million that have so far been released. Even then, the 3 million documents account for only about half of the DOJ’s entire file on Epstein. “We need to be investigating the money, we need to be investigating the organizational hierarchy,” Raskin said. “There’s no way you run a billion-dollar international child sex trafficking ring with just two people committing crimes.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Your membership allows us to name harmful rhetoric, provide context, and report with integrity—standing up for truth and accountability. Already a member? Log in to hide these messages. Capitalism is truly coming back to bite us... Senior Wellness Reporter, HuffPost For many people, the Super Bowl commercials are reason enough to watch the big game. Iconic ads like Britney Spears’ 2001 Joy of Pepsi commercial and Betty White’s football-playing Snickers ad are almost as legendary as the event itself. That wasn’t the case with the commercials during Super Bowl LX, however. Instead of funny commercials that were great for Monday water-cooler conversations, we got ads that centered on artificial intelligence, cryptocurrency, GLP-1s, and Trump agenda items like Trump accounts for kids and “Make America Healthy Again.” People on social media couldn’t help but draw a very specific ― and dark ― conclusion: The commercials really say a lot about the state of the world. “The Super Bowl commercials last night were so damn scary. Straight out of a Black Mirror episode,” one Threads user wrote. Another noted: “The Super Bowl commercials are all the same. AI, crypto, Scientology. Yeah we get it you’re in a cult.” Some of the ads may have started out exciting ― or even moving ― just for jump-scare branding to pop up at the end. A viral video on X shows Super Bowl partygoers happily belting out the Backstreet Boys, karaoke-style, along with an ad — until the name of the cryptocurrency company Coinbase appears on screen. TV-watchers responded with “boos” and middle finger gestures. There was also that Ring commercial about the company’s new “search party” feature, AI-based surveillance that Ring camera users can opt in to. The Super Bowl ad showed the feature being used to track down lost dogs, but many on social media saw a surveillance state and shared rumors that Ring allows U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to use its footage for immigration raids. (The company has publicly denied this.) “Guys, I’m gonna need you to understand that the Ring commercial was not about finding lost dogs,” one Threads user wrote. “Ring is not trying to help anyone locate lost dogs. That commercial was a dog whistle. Abolish ring AND ice,” another posted. These commercials painted a clear, dystopian picture of life in the United States now. The truth is, we’re living at a time when costs are soaring, job losses are rampant, and residents of states like Minnesota are afraid to leave their homes and go to school as ICE agents forcefully detain citizens and noncitizens alike. There are plenty of reasons you may be feeling bleak — even gaslighted — because of these commercials. As AI companies (Google Gemini, OpenAI and others) try and convince people that AI really isn’t that bad, people are losing their jobs because AI is replacing human work. And as millions of Americans lose their access to food stamps because of the so-called “Big, Beautiful Bill,” an ad by RealFood.gov (paid for by the Robert F. Kennedy Jr.-aligned MAHA Center Inc.) told people to “eat real food.” “Capitalism is damaging your mental health,” licensed professional counselor Jeff Guenther, who goes by @TherapyJeff on social media, wrote in an article about the topic. These ads reinforce the key pillars of capitalism, including materialism, competitiveness and individualism (pull yourself up by your bootstraps! No more food stamps for you!), factors that were mentioned in a 2021 meta-analysis that linked the consequences of neoliberal capitalist policies to depression and anxiety. Simply put: We’re burned out by the state of the world, and the ads seem to reflect some of the very reasons why. Experts also say the U.S. is undergoing a time of “national trauma,” and your body can’t tell the difference between a threat right in front of you and a threat on your TV or phone. So whether you’re watching a Ring doorbell commercial on a screen or dealing with a real-life stressor in front of you, your body’s stress response will activate if it bothers you ― leading to a faster heart rate, the release of stress hormones and more. And over time, this stress response can lead to feelings of fatigue, mood swings, digestive problems, depression and emotional numbness. Are Super Bowl commercials the problem to focus on fixing? Of course not. They’re more like a microcosm of the stressors that many people have been navigating for much longer. There are some things you can do to mitigate the stress that the current reality brings, such as spending time with loved ones and getting outside to exercise. It can also be a good idea to set boundaries around how often you’re checking the news or social media. While it’s important to stay informed, you don’t need to consume everything in order to feel like you’re doing something. And at the very least, know you’re not alone in feeling disturbed by it all.

Become a member and help keep fearless reporting independent. Already a member? Log in to hide these messages. Analilia Mejia benefited from her steadfast opposition to ICE to win a district previously held by a moderate. Senior Political Reporter, HuffPost Progressive activist Analilia Mejia won the Democratic primary in a special election to represent the New Jersey suburbs in Congress, a significant win for the left in the ongoing battles over the party’s ideological direction and a massive own goal by pro-Israel groups who attacked the front-runner in the race. Her victory became official when former Rep. Tom Malinowski, who had been trailing Mejia by less than a thousand votes since election night last Thursday, conceded on Tuesday morning. Mejia campaigned with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), and had the backing of a host of other left-wing groups and figures. A former political director for Sanders’ presidential campaign and leader of the progressive Center for Popular Democracy, Mejia began the race with significantly less name identification than her opponents, but benefited from both high-profile endorsements and from Democrats’ increased opposition to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. “Traditional politics and the same ol’ blue is not going to be effective in confronting MAGA Trumpism and a corrupt administration,” she said in an interview before the election. “I wanted a different voice for myself, and I know that my friends and neighbors in the district did too.” In a press conference the day after her win, Mejia said voters appreciated her push to abolish ICE and replace the nation’s internal immigration enforcement agency. “You cannot watch what’s happening in Minnesota, what happened in Chicago, what happened in California, what happened in Morristown across this district — you can’t look at it and not see it for what it is,” she said. “ICE is completely overreaching. It’s a bloated agency that I believe cannot be reformed. It’s only existed for 22 years. It must be replaced by something that isn’t violent.” What makes Mejia’s win remarkable is both whom she beat and where she won. She not only defeated the race’s front-runner, former Rep. Tom Malinowski, but also the preferred candidate of New Jersey’s once-feared political machine, Essex County Councilmember Brendan Gill, and former Lt. Gov. Tahesha Way, who received millions of dollars of outside support and was the preferred candidate of pro-Israel groups. And the 11th District, which was previously held by moderate Gov. Mikie Sherrill and consists of suburbs in northern and central New Jersey, is not like most other districts represented by progressives. It’s highly educated, majority white and wealthy. It’s also far less Democratic than the other districts represented by the Squad members Mejia is often compared to: The 11th District has a Cook partisan voter index score of just D+5, compared to D+19 for Ocasio-Cortez’s district and D+32, D+21 and D+34 for districts represented by Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts. While the race served as a preview to the upcoming Democratic primary season, elements of Mejia’s win may be difficult for the left to replicate elsewhere. The divided field ― there were four candidates seen as truly competitive, plus a handful more who waged real campaigns ― allowed Mejia to win with roughly 30% of the vote. And in many races, a candidate with Mejia’s ideological profile will suffer from heavy outside spending rather than benefit from it. The decision by United Democracy Project, an AIPAC-linked super PAC, to spend $3 million attacking Malinowski over his support for putting conditions on aid to Israel, however, clearly backfired here. The super PAC’s ads targeted Malinowski for voting to fund ICE during an earlier stint in Congress, which ultimately benefited Mejia, who takes a more critical line on Israel ― she’s called the assault on Gaza a “genocide” ― than the former congressman. Mejia is a strong favorite to win the general election in the race in April, but will have to run in another Democratic primary in June and win another general election in November to earn a full term. While Malinowski and Gill both said they would not run for a full term if they lost the special election, Way has not. In a statement, United Democracy Project indicated both that it was aware of the risk it took in attacking Malinowski and that it could get involved in the June primary to stop Mejia from winning a full term. “The outcome in NJ-11 was an anticipated possibility, and our focus remains on who will serve the next full term in Congress,” the group said. “UDP will be closely monitoring dozens of primary races, including the June NJ-11 primary, to help ensure pro-Israel candidates are elected to Congress.” In his concession statement, Malinowski tore into AIPAC and UDP and warned them against getting involved in the June primary. “Our Democratic Party should have nothing to do with a pro-Trump, billionaire-funded organization that demands absolute fealty to positions that are outside the mainstream of the American pro-Israel community, and then smears those who don’t fall into line,” he wrote. “If AIPAC backs a candidate ― openly or surreptitiously ― in the June NJ-11 Congressional primary, I will oppose that candidate and urge my supporters to do so as well.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Become a member and help keep fearless reporting independent. Already a member? Log in to hide these messages. While America’s elite skirt Epstein-related repercussions, the files have swiftly toppled princes, diplomats and career politicians across Europe. Senior Reporter, HuffPost Members of the political elite are facing near-immediate consequences as the ongoing dump of Jeffrey Epstein files reveals their association with the convicted sex offender. At least, that’s the case in Europe. In the United States, not so much. The Epstein documents released by the U.S. Justice Department have led to swift repercussions for public figures in Europe who were found to have ties to the American financier. Accountability has come in the form of political and criminal investigations, as well as ousters from positions of power. Most high-profile American figures have yet to face serious consequences. There has been some movement: Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers left his position at Harvard University last year. Brad Karp stepped down as chair of the major law firm Paul Weiss, though he remains employed there. The NFL announced an investigation into New York Giants co-owner Steve Tisch over his emails with Epstein. But big names like far-right figure Steve Bannon, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, billionaire Elon Musk and President Donald Trump himself have so far managed to skirt any public reckoning. Trump’s name comes up thousands of times in the latest documents, though Epstein’s victims have not accused the president of any wrongdoing. “People are losing their jobs in England right now, it is a huge political scandal there,” Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said Monday of the files. “I’m just afraid that the general coarsening and degradation of American life has somehow conditioned people not to take this as seriously as we should be taking it.” Here are the major European figures who have faced Epstein-related consequences: Former Prince Andrew is so far the only major figure in Europe who has faced specific allegations of sexual misconduct related to Epstein. The disgraced royal paid millions in 2022 to settle a lawsuit with Virginia Giuffre, a prominent Epstein victim who said the prince sexually assaulted her when she was 17. Giuffre died by suicide last year at 41. British police said Monday that they are investigating claims that Mountbatten-Windsor also shared confidential trade reports with Epstein while holding public office. The correspondence was among the document batch released last month. King Charles III said he will support police in their probe, though it appears his brother is still staying at the king’s private Sandringham estate. Mountbatten-Windsor lost his honors, princely title and mansion before the latest Epstein documents were even released. His ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, also shut down her charity last week after the files revealed the former Duchess of York had maintained contact with Epstein while he was in prison, calling him “the brother I have always wished for.” British Prime Minister Keir Starmer appointed Mandelson as U.K. ambassador to the U.S. before firing him in September for keeping friendly ties with Epstein even after the latter’s conviction. Despite downplaying his relationship with the financier, Mandelson maintained contact long after Epstein’s prison term for child sex abuse ended. In 2009, Mandelson sent a message that appeared to call Epstein’s prison release “liberation day.” Mandelson’s association with Epstein has shaken the U.K. government. British police are now investigating whether the politician passed on sensitive government information to Epstein while holding public office. Mandelson quit the Labour Party and the House of Lords. Starmer’s chief of staff and his communications director also resigned for advising him to appoint Mandelson as ambassador, though the prime minister himself faces intense backlash over his poor judgment in the appointment. Anas Sarwar, who leads Scotland’s Labour Party, called for Starmer’s resignation on Monday. Juul resigned on Sunday as Norway’s ambassador to Jordan while the country’s Foreign Ministry investigates her contacts with Epstein. She was suspended from her position days earlier, according to Foreign Minister Espen Barthe Eide. The resignation came after reports that Epstein left $10 million to the children of Juul and her husband, Rød-Larsen, in a will the financier drew up before his 2019 death in prison. The ministry is also reviewing its funding of the International Peace Institute while the think tank was led by Rød-Larsen. Eide said the couple, both of whom helped facilitate the Oslo Accords, demonstrated poor judgment in their Epstein ties. The Norwegian Economic Crime Investigation Service is investigating the country’s former prime minister over whether his recently revealed ties to Epstein resulted in political corruption. The files included emails between Jagland and Epstein that showed the Norwegian leader made plans to visit the convicted sex offender’s island with his family in 2014, and that an Epstein assistant organized the flights. Jagland was chairing the Norwegian Nobel Committee at the time. The revelation has resulted in authorities looking into whether Jagland received gifts, travel or loans in connection with his titles. Norwegian broadcaster NRK said that Jagland is cooperating with the probe. France’s former culture minister has resigned as head of the Arab World Institute in Paris after his reported business ties with Epstein resulted in authorities investigating him for alleged “aggravated tax fraud laundering.” Lang — who was mentioned more than 600 times in the files, according to The Associated Press — maintained financial ties with Epstein via an offshore company in the U.S. Virgin Islands, according to French investigative news outlet Mediapart. He denies the allegations, his lawyer told RTL radio on Sunday. The official submitted his resignation before he was set to appear at the French Foreign Ministry, which oversees the institute Lang had led since 2013. The ministry said it has “taken note” of his resignation. The Slovakian prime minister’s national security adviser resigned on Saturday over last week’s document release that revealed his past communications with Epstein. The files included messages from 2018 between Epstein and Lajčak, in which the financier appears to offer girls to the veteran politician during a conversation about the then-foreign minister’s meetings with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov. Lajčak said he did not recall the text exchange, but told Radio Slovakia on Monday that he felt like a “fool” reading them again. The official said the conversation about girls was “nothing more than foolish male egos” and “self-satisfied male banter.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

The “Daily Show” host tore into the president and his supporters for needing “safe spaces.” Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost “Daily Show” host Jon Stewart on Monday had one biting question for President Donald Trump and his supporters in the MAGA-centric right-wing media circuit. “When did the right become such fucking pussies?” he asked. Stewart showed clips of the latest meltdowns over everything from Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl halftime performance ― which had them so triggered that they needed their own conservative halftime show ― to their anger over Olympians who’ve spoken out against Trump and his policies, with many on the right demanding that they be sent home. “Remember 2017?” he asked. “Remember what you hated about liberals?” He showed a graphic from Fox News at the time explaining the supposed “signs of snowflakery,” including being “perpetually offended,” in need of “safe spaces,” attempting to “shut down speech,” and embracing a “culture of victimhood.” “Remind you of anyone?” he asked. Then he switched his voice to a whine to mock conservatives. “Oh, I can’t go 15 minutes without listening to country music. I need a separate show,” he moaned. “Oh, that skier triggered me. I can’t sleep.” He added a blunt message for Trump and his supporters: “It’s actually fucking pathetic, the gap between the power you all wield... and the victimhood you all claim is the real offense. If you didn’t actually have the power to do so much damage in our country, I think we’d all dismiss it as a weak and pathetic pity party.

Become a member and help keep fearless reporting independent. Already a member? Log in to hide these messages. Trump fired off an attack on a country that had long been a key U.S. ally. Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Critics are questioning President Donald Trump’s mental health after his latest bizarre rant in which he threatened Canada with new penalties, then delivered a wild warning about the country’s favorite sport. Trump’s 296-word screed, which was posted on his Truth Social website on Monday, claimed that Canada had “treated the United States very unfairly” and threatened to keep a new bridge between the two countries closed unless Canada ― which paid for the bridge ― gave the United States “at least one half of this asset.” Somewhere in the middle of that lengthy post, Trump took a detour to China. And hockey. Trump railed against Canada and China for attempting to improve trade cooperation, starting with a deal last month to reduce tariffs on canola and electric vehicles. Trump wrote: ″...Prime Minister Carney wants to make a deal with China — which will eat Canada alive. We’ll just get the leftovers! I don’t think so. The first thing China will do is terminate ALL Ice Hockey being played in Canada, and permanently eliminate The Stanley Cup.” The Stanley Cup is the most prestigious trophy in the National Hockey League. Twenty-five of the NHL’s 32 teams are American, and no Canadian team has won the Stanley Cup in decades. Trump made a similar claim about China forcing Canada to stop playing hockey last month that he still hasn’t explained. The president’s critics are also finding this comment hard to comprehend ― even by Trump’s usual standards. They hit back on social media: The man is hanging on by such a thin thread, the best he could come up with is “No hockey for you!” Our president is insane, and he’s destroying our alliances by the minute while the rest of the world looks on in bewilderment wondering what the heck is wrong with us. https://t.co/zG5Pr6aYnU When will the relevant US authorities - the republicans in the US Congress - realize that Trump is seriously mentally ill and needs to be taken out of action?Impeachment or 25th Amendment! https://t.co/0tfbFhYIk9 You got to question the mental state of this individual. Something is clearly wrong. https://t.co/tRCjowRd2x The idea of China's ultimate goal being the destruction of The Stanley Cup is so, so funny to me.

European correspondent, HuffPost Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) failed to medal with his ultimatum to U.S. athletes competing at the 2026 Winter Olympics, after several said they aren’t happy with what’s going on in America under Donald Trump’s administration. “Any person who goes to the Olympics to represent the United States and then says they don’t want to represent the United States should be immediately stripped of their Olympic uniform,” Scott fumed in a video shared on X. Representing the United States—a beacon for freedom and democracy—at the Olympics is an honor. Anyone who feels otherwise should be stripped of their USA Olympic uniform. pic.twitter.com/fciWOd8THX Scott, a Trump acolyte, wrote in the clip’s caption that the United States is a “beacon for freedom and democracy” — even though he doesn’t want athletes to use their freedom of speech to say what’s on their minds. Critics on social media pointed out that loving America doesn’t mean agreeing with every Trump policy. They also defended athletes’ right to express their views. Freedom, democracy, and mandatory loyalty oaths from Rick Scott. Nothing screams “beacon” like authoritarian vibes wrapped in a flag. Freedom of speech. Also, shut up. Of course our Olympic athletes are ashamed of what is happening here. YOU SHOULD BE. They have every right to speak out. Am I supposed to care what a non-athlete thinks of the Olympics?Are we supposed to value his words because he's a politician? Anyone who feels this way should be voted out as a US Senator or Representative. I see someone received the administration's talking points. Good boy! Sorry Rick, everyone in those Olympics loves their country, but maybe not the president or his policy! There is NOTHING wrong with NOT supporting various opinions, or actions, especially if they are way off color or involve mistreatment of citizens of humanity! WE ALL have… We’re so free that if you don’t like us, we’ll punish you! They didn't said they dont want to represent the United States they said they dont want some of the values of our current government to represent them! I support the Olympic athletes and I'm proud of them. They are the quality of human that the world needs. Good people.

Become a member and help keep fearless reporting independent. Already a member? Log in to hide these messages. Alan Kildow also revealed the American superstar's future at Milan Cortina 2026. CORTINA D’AMPEZZO, Italy (AP) — Lindsey Vonn’s father said Monday that the American superstar will no longer race if he has any influence over her decision and that she will not return to the Winter Olympics after breaking her left leg in the downhill over the weekend. “She’s 41 years old and this is the end of her career,” Alan Kildow said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. “There will be no more ski races for Lindsey Vonn, as long as I have anything to say about it.” Kildow and the rest of Vonn’s family — a brother and two sisters — have been with Vonn while she is being treated at a hospital in Treviso following her fall and helicopter evacuation from the course in Cortina on Sunday. Vonn said late Monday on Instagram that she had sustained a “complex tibia fracture that is currently stable but will require multiple surgeries to fix properly.” Kildow declined to comment on the injuries, but he did address how Vonn was doing emotionally. “She’s a very strong individual,” Kildow said. “She knows physical pain and she understands the circumstances that she finds herself in. And she’s able to handle it. Better than I expected. She’s a very, very strong person. And so I think she’s handling it real well.” Kildow — a former ski racer himself who taught his daughter to race — said he slept in his daughter’s hospital room overnight. “She has somebody with her — or multiple people with her — at all times,” Kildow said. “We’ll have people here as long as she’s here.” Kildow and the rest of Vonn’s family watched the crash from the finish area with all of the other spectators. “First, the shock and the horror of the whole thing, seeing a crash like that,” Kildow said of what he felt watching the scene unfold. “It can be dramatic and traumatic. You’re just horrified at what those kinds of impacts have. “You can go into a shock an emotional psychological shock,” he added. “Because it’s difficult to just accept what’s happened. But she’s well cared for. … And the USOC and the U.S. Ski team have a very, very top-notch doctor with her and she is being very well cared for here in Italy.” Vonn raced the downhill despite tearing the ACL in her left knee nine days earlier in another crash. “What happened to her had nothing to do with the ACL issue on her left leg. Nothing,” Kildow said. “She had demonstrated that she was able to function at a very high level with the two downhill training runs. … And she had been cleared by high level physicians to ski.” Kildow said the crash was less a result of Vonn’s knee injury than the way she pushed the limits of her racing line to the point where she clipped a gate early in her run and got knocked out of control. “There are times sometimes in any race, but especially in downhill, where you have to take a little speed off,” he said. “You can give yourself a little bit more leeway on the line so you don’t put yourself in a questionable position.” Vonn, who holds the record of 12 World Cup victories in Cortina, returned to the circuit last season after nearly six years of retirement and after a partial titanium replacement surgery in her right knee. She won two downhills and finished on the podium in seven of the eight World Cup races that she finished this season — and came fourth in the other one. “She won 84 World Cup races. And not many people do that,” Kildow said, referring to Vonn’s victory total, which place her second on the all-time women’s list behind teammate Mikaela Shiffrin’s record 108 wins. “And there’s a hell of a lot of the difference between a speed race, a downhill especially, and a slalom,” Kildow added. Vonn will not return to the Olympics to cheer on teammates or for anything else, Kildow said. “No, she’s not that in kind of situation,” he said. “She will be going home at an appropriate point in time.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Become a member and help keep fearless reporting independent. Already a member? Log in to hide these messages. “I think in moments like these, it is really important for us to unite and kind of stand up for one another for all that’s going on,"" said the snowboard champ. LIVIGNO, Italy (AP) — Chloe Kim and Eileen Gu, two Olympic standouts who have faced their share of hate over the years, each weighed in Monday on Donald Trump’s bashing of their friend, American freeskier Hunter Hess, for having said he didn’t back the U.S. president’s heightened crackdown on immigrants. “I think in moments like these, it is really important for us to unite and kind of stand up for one another for all that’s going on,” said Kim, the two-time Olympic gold medalist whose parents are South Korean immigrants and who has faced racism throughout her career for her Asian heritage. Gu, the American-born freeskier who competes for China, said after her silver-medal win in slopestyle that she had been in touch with Hess, who told her she was one of the few people who could relate to what he’s going through. “As someone who’s been caught in the crossfire before, I feel sorry for the athletes,” said Gu, who was born in San Francisco and whose decision to compete for China turned her into a lightning rod. Hess drew Trump’s ire when he was asked by reporters to give his views on the immigration crackdown that has claimed the lives of two protestors in Minnesota and disrupted thousands of lives of immigrants and U.S. citizens. Hess answered: “Just because I’m wearing the flag doesn’t mean I represent everything that’s going on in the U.S.” The next day, Trump lashed out at Hess on his Truth Social account, calling him “a real Loser” and saying he would be hard pressed to root for him at the Games. Hess’s friends — snowboarders and freeskiers competing this week in Livigno — were asked for their reaction. “My parents being immigrants from Korea, this one definitely hits pretty close to home,” said Kim, who begins defense of her title Wednesday. “I’m really proud to represent the United States,” she said. “The U.S. has given my family and I so much opportunity, but I also think that we are allowed to voice our opinions of what’s going that we need to lead with love and compassion.” Other American snowboarders spoke out for diversity and the right of expression. “I think there are a lot of different opinions in the U.S. right now. Obviously we’re very divided,” snowboarder Bea Kim said. “I personally am very proud to represent the United States. That being said, I think diversity is what makes us a very strong country and what makes that so special.” Teammate Maddie Mastro added: “I’m also saddened with what’s happening at home.” “It’s really tough and I feel like we can’t turn a blind eye to that. But at the same time, I represent a country that has the same values as mine of kindness and compassion. And we come together in times of injustice,” Mastro said. Gu called it “an unwinnable press war” for Hess and lamented the fact that the controversy could be a distraction for the athletes, and overshadow the beauty of the biggest event in winter sports. “I’m sorry that the headline that is eclipsing the Olympics has to be something so ... unrelated to the spirit of the Games,” she said. “It really runs contrary to everything that the Olympics should be.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Become a member and help keep fearless reporting independent. Already a member? Log in to hide these messages. Trump has attacked others for having visited Epstein’s notorious Caribbean island, but appears to be fine with his commerce secretary’s apparent trip there. Senior White House Correspondent, HuffPost WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump is standing by his commerce secretary despite newly released documents indicating Howard Lutnick visited deceased pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein’s notorious Caribbean island years after Epstein’s criminal conviction and even as congressional calls for his resignation grow. Lutnick, one of Trump’s top economic advisers, discussed traveling to Little St. James in 2012, according to documents released by the Justice Department in response to a new law demanding the investigatory files in the Epstein prosecution. A follow-up email from Epstein’s assistant appears to confirm Lutnick did, in fact, travel to the island. The apparent trip took place four years after Epstein pleaded guilty to procuring a minor for prostitution. The emails contradict earlier statements by Lutnick, the former CEO of investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald, suggesting he had cut off ties with Epstein and did not engage with him socially despite living next door to the financier in New York. The Commerce Department released a statement attacking the news media — “This is nothing more than a failing attempt by the legacy media to distract from the administration’s accomplishments.” – and did not respond to follow-up questions about the apparent 2012 visit. White House staff similarly dodged the specifics of HuffPost’s query. “The entire Trump administration, including Secretary Lutnick and the Department of Commerce, remains focused on delivering for the American people,” spokesman Kush Desai said. Trump himself last week claimed he didn’t know anything about either Lutnick’s or billionaire and political benefactor Elon Musk’s presence in the Epstein files. “I have a lot of things I’m doing, you know, a lot of things. I don’t know. You mentioned two names. I’m sure they’re fine. I’m sure they’re fine,” he told reporters during an Oval Office photo opportunity. “Otherwise, there would have been major headlines.” In fact, there have been headlines, particularly about Lutnick, whose anti-trade, pro-tariff advice has dominated Trump’s international economic policy since he returned to office. It also led to calls from Democratic members of Congress for Lutnick to resign his Cabinet post — calls that were joined Sunday by Kentucky Republican Thomas Massie, one of the House’s main proponents of the Epstein file legislation. “Really, he should make life easier on the president, frankly, and just resign,” Massie told CNN. Lutnick, who lived next door to Epstein in Manhattan, claimed in a podcast last year: “I was never in the room with him socially, for business or even philanthropy.” That assertion, however, is belied by the DOJ documents, which include emails showing how the two of them were in business together and also socialized. In 2013, Epstein obtained the résumé of Lutnick’s nanny. The trip to Little St. James, a tiny islet a few miles off St. Thomas, is noteworthy because Epstein’s victims describe it as a site where Epstein sexually assaulted them and offered them to some of his visitors. There is no evidence that Lutnick interacted with any underage girls during his visit there or at Epstein’s townhouse next door to his own. But Trump in the past has suggested simply visiting the island is worthy of condemnation, falsely attacking former President Bill Clinton for traveling there. White House chief of staff Susie Wiles conceded in an interview published last year there was no evidence Clinton ― who was friends with Epstein before his 2008 arrest ― had set foot on Little St. James. New Mexico Rep. Melanie Stansbury, a member of the House Oversight Committee, said she and other Democrats on the panel would like to subpoena Lutnick to appear before the committee but that Republicans were not interested in doing so. “Of course we would like to speak to Secretary Lutnick, and I personally believe that Mr. Lutnick needs to step down immediately,” she said. Trump himself had a long friendship with Epstein, which included socializing with both him and his accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell. Trump has claimed he ended the relationship after Epstein recruited young girls from his South Florida country club, Mar-a-Lago. However, that recruiting took place starting no later than 2000, and Epstein remained a Mar-a-Lago member until 2007. When asked why it took him seven years to ban Epstein from his club, Trump claimed last year he did not understand the question. And on Monday, Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin, the Democratic ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, said an email between Maxwell and Epstein said that in the 2009 period, Epstein was still visiting Mar-a-Lago and had never been asked to stay away. “And that was redacted for some … inscrutable reason,” he told reporters after reviewing some of the redacted files in their entirety at a DOJ office. Trump has boasted that while he was invited to visit Epstein’s island, he never went and should be given credit for that. “I never had the privilege of going to his island, and I did turn it down. But a lot of people in Palm Beach were invited to his island. In one of my very good moments, I turned it down. I didn’t want to go to his island,” he told reporters last summer during his visit to his golf course in Scotland. Epstein died by apparent suicide in 2019 a month after he was arrested on child sex trafficking charges. Maxwell was arrested the following year, was convicted at trial in late 2021 and in 2022 was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison. She was last summer moved to a minimum-security “Club Fed” type prison camp after meeting with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who previously had been one of Trump’s numerous criminal defense lawyers. Also Monday, Maxwell claimed her Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate herself during a videotaped deposition with the House Oversight Committee. Her lawyer said she would answer questions only if Trump granted her clemency. HuffPost reporter Arthur Delaney contributed.

Senior Reporter, HuffPost Steve Bannon’s name is in the Epstein files, and many of his friends now seem to be former friends. On Sunday and Monday, prominent right-wingers took to social media to lambaste Bannon’s relationship with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein ― even though the friendship has been common knowledge for years. Recently released documents from the Department of Justice show that Epstein and Bannon were working on a documentary that was intended, as Bannon wrote to Epstein, to “push back on the lies” and “rebuild” Epstein’s image as a “philanthropist,” according to the BBC. Epstein’s 2019 death put the kibosh on the project, and the location of the reported 17 hours of interview footage remains a mystery, according to Donald Trump biographer Michael Wolff. Although some of Bannon’s fans have expressed shock at his connections to Epstein, the big names in conservative media didn’t make a big deal ― until recently. Now, major conservatives are coming forward to criticize Bannon for being in bed with Epstein, and they’re not holding back. Infamous Republican political dirty trickster Roger Stone slammed Bannon in two posts. The first post, on Sunday, praised Elon Musk for being right about Bannon, but didn’t offer specifics. Musk previously said in a July 4 social media battle that “fat drunken slob” Bannon should be in prison. Then, in Monday’s post, Stone attacked “Stinky Steve” for being “very far up Epstein’s ass” and “advising him on how to lie his way out of his criminal pedophile past.” .@elonmusk certainly turned out to be right about Steve Bannon.https://t.co/ZhIInhYTTQ That's our stinky Steve. Read the emails. He was very far up Epstein's ass and was advising him on how to lie his way out of his criminal pedophile past Stone wasn’t alone in his attacks, which came at a time when U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro announced plans to help Bannon erase evidence of his conviction for defying a subpoena from the Jan. 6 Committee. Dinesh D’Souza, the conservative filmmaker behind the widely debunked conspiracy film “2000 Mules,” mocked the hypocrisy of Bannon sucking up to elites while claiming to promote populism. Steve Bannon, man of the people. pic.twitter.com/q1tS6wQB98 Musk joined in on the beatdown Monday morning by sharing a post noting the deep connection between Bannon, Trump’s former White House advisor, and Epstein, Trump’s former close friend and neighbor. He captioned the post, “Bannon is evil.” Bannon is evil https://t.co/pQOO0hlaf2 Fox News’ Mark Levin thought it was “funny” that Bannon’s “fellow antisemites and isolationists have not demanded that HE come clean about his well-established, video-taped relationship with Epstein.” Funny how Bannon's fellow antisemites and isolationists have not demanded that HE come clean about his well-established, video-taped relationship with Epstein. Bannongate, Epstein's Boy https://t.co/Gpkvm5J8xN Right-wing talk show host Erick Erickson said Bannon’s close ties with Epstein and the Chinese Communist Party should make people “raise more than a single eyebrow when conservative influencers go on Bannon’s program.” Between his close ties to the Chinese Communist Party and Jeffrey Epstein, we should all raise more than a single eyebrow when conservative influencers go on Bannon's program. https://t.co/HO198dyMMO Others chimed in.... Bannon’s need to get on the ins with Epstein is a fascinating psychological case study https://t.co/Vbg5T5ecfW We rarely agree, but you're right to go to the Moon first, and you're super-right about Bannon. https://t.co/YZFWOMRCbm It's easy to see who takes his money and relies on his influencer network, because they're all silent about his overt friendship and working relationship with Epstein.You know who you are.

After months of limbo, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., blocked the administration from ending the program — for now. The ruling was “a relief,” said Carline, who is only being identified by her first name because she’s worried about being targeted by immigration officials. It was also likely the beginning of a long legal process that will leave Haitian immigrants in the U.S. on edge. “We can go out, we can go to work, and we can continue on,” she said. “But that doesn’t mean everything is over.” The Trump administration officially filed an appeal of the decision on Friday with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The administration is hoping to take the case all the way to the highest court. “Supreme Court, here we come,” Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, posted on X after the ruling. “Temporary means temporary and the final word will not be from an activist judge legislating from the bench.” The Supreme Court weighed in on a different TPS case last year, allowing the administration’s termination of TPS for Venezuelans to go into effect. TPS is a special status given to immigrants from countries that are facing civil unrest, political upheaval or a natural disaster. The program allows recipients to legally work and live in the United States without fear of deportation and requires them to reapply about every 18 months to keep their status. Haitians became eligible for TPS after a 2010 earthquake killed approximately 200,000 people and again in 2021 after Haitian President Jovenel Moïse was assassinated. If their legal status is terminated, there will be untold consequences. Thousands of people, including kids, will be suddenly eligible for deportation — and the government has their addresses and employment information. “When you lose TPS, you lose everything,” Jose Palma, a coordinator at the National TPS Alliance, an organization made up of legal aid, immigrant rights and labor groups, told HuffPost. For Carline, everything might include her job, medical insurance and ability to drive. It might also include her child’s safety. “I won’t drive if I don’t have papers,” she said. “I won’t have insurance either. I don’t know what I’m going to do.” She’s worried about losing her work permit — but also about immigration agents targeting her at her job as a certified nursing assistant at a hospital in suburban Washington, D.C. “I was thinking about putting in my resignation early,” Carline said. “I don’t want to go to work and for them to come get me there.” But she’s not sure what else she would do. “They’re saying don’t go to work, try to find a job where they pay you cash under the table so at least you can survive,” Carline said about advice from immigrant advocates. Carline, who first came to the United States on a tourist visa in 2019, switched to a student visa to study nursing. She applied for TPS because it was the only way she could legally work to provide for her 13-year-old son, who is a U.S. citizen through his other parent. “When I saw the news about the 5-year-old, I told my son, ‘Don’t walk anywhere you’re not familiar with,’” Carline said, referring to Liam Conejo Ramos, a child whom agents detained in Minneapolis. The photo of Ramos, standing in front of a federal agent with an oversized hat and Spider-Man backpack, quickly went viral. There are an estimated 260,000 children living with TPS holders. “Many TPS recipients have been living in the U.S. for more than two decades,” Palma said. “We have mixed-status families, so the first consequence is breaking families apart.” “They’re scared, they’re anxious, and they’re staying in their homes.” President Donald Trump has been targeting Haitians for years. During his first term, Haiti was among the countries he called “shitholes.” (He denied using the term for years, but admitted to it at a rally in December.) Then, during the 2024 presidential campaign, a racist Facebook rumor about Haitians eating people’s pets in Springfield, Ohio, went viral. Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, both repeated the lie, even as Springfield dealt with bomb threats and school evacuations over the false claim. Before the ruling last week, there were several reports that ICE was planning on beginning an operation in Springfield with Haitians as the target. Fears were mounting that the administration’s foray into Minneapolis could be replicated in Springfield. After all, ICE descended into Minnesota after Trump saw a viral video alleging massive financial fraud in Somali-run day cares. Since then, federal immigration agents there have killed two people, detained children, and forced people into hiding. The anxiety in Springfield has been widespread. “They’re scared, they’re anxious, and they’re staying in their homes,” Jen Casto, a local organizer and Springfield native, told HuffPost before the ruling. Revoking TPS would be catastrophic for the city. “I think we’re gonna see a lot of displaced children who were born here starting in 2021,” Casto said. “What if both parents have TPS?” It’s unclear if the region’s social services would be able to handle a large influx of displaced children. Lynn Tramonte, the executive director of Ohio Immigrant Alliance, said some recipients are still making plans about what to do with their children should the worst come to pass. “People are figuring out, if I get deported, is it better to bring my kid with me to Haiti,” Tramonte said, “or do I leave them here with somebody I trust?” “You can’t really take a full breath in,” she said. “You’re kind of living with a hammer over your head.” The revocation of TPS would likely result in substantial hits to the economies and communities that rely on Haitian immigrants. TPS holders have contributed billions of dollars to the U.S. economy, and industries like construction and health care could suddenly be short of vital staff if Haitians lose TPS. “There’s going to be a lot of mutual aid needed, at least initially,” Casto said. “We’re going to have a humanitarian crisis.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Buckingham Palace said it is “ready to support” a potential police probe into the ex-royal following a claim of improper emails with the late sex offender. Senior Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost The British monarchy is further distancing itself from the disgraced former Prince Andrew, as Prince William and his wife on Monday publicly expressed concern over mounting allegations against the ex-royal and Buckingham Palace said it would support a potential police investigation. In a statement Monday, the palace said it is “ready to support” the local Thames Valley Police force shortly after the former royal — who is now known simply as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor — was accused of sharing confidential reports with Epstein while serving as U.K. trade envoy. Thames Valley Police covers areas west of London, including Windsor, where the former royal has a home. “The King has made clear, in words and through unprecedented actions, his profound concern at allegations which continue to come to light in respect of Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor’s conduct,” read the statement, referring to the ex-royal’s brother, King Charles III. “While the specific claims in question are for Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor to address, if we are approached by Thames Valley Police we stand ready to support them as you would expect,” it went on. The Thames Valley Police force confirmed to the BBC and CNN that it is looking into the email allegations lobbed Monday against Mountbatten-Windsor by the anti-monarchy group Republic. A communications officer with Republic told HuffPost that its complaint “was done due to the strength of allegations in a report from the BBC over the weekend.” Emails reviewed by the BBC have suggested that Mountbatten-Windsor improperly sent Epstein reports from a 2010 tour of Southeast Asia that he took while serving as Britain’s envoy for international trade. He held that role from 2001 to 2011. The emails were reportedly found among the millions of files released last month by the U.S. Department of Justice in relation to Epstein. Graham Smith, Republic’s chief executive, confirmed in a social media post that he reported Mountbatten-Windsor for suspected misconduct in public office and breach of official secrets in relation to these specific allegations. Smith wrote that he “cannot see any significant difference between these allegations and those against Peter Mandelson,” the former British ambassador to the U.S. who was fired last year over his ties to Epstein. In addition to having a friendship with Epstein, Mandelson has been accused of sharing confidential U.K. government information with Epstein when he was a British minister. News of the potential police probe came shortly after Prince William and Princess Catherine released their first public statement addressing deepening allegations against William’s uncle. The couple said they “have been deeply concerned by the continued revelations” and “their thoughts remain focused on the victims.” Mountbatten-Windsor was stripped of his royal title last year following allegations that he sexually assaulted a minor whom he met through Epstein. He has denied any wrongdoing. By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.
